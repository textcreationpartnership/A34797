            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter long deliberation, I hardly induced my ſelf to crave your gracious protection towards this ſimple work: va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing it at ſo low a price, as I think it hardly worth the reſpect of any grave man, much leſſe the favourable aſpect of ſo honourable a perſonage. Yet the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of thoſe your Fatherly provocations, whereby, at my coming to your Grace from the Univerſity, you firſt put me upon theſe ſtudies, at the laſt, by a kind of neceſsity, inforced me to this attempt; becauſe I could not ſee how well to avoid it, but by adventuring the hatefull note of unthankfulneſs. For I cannot without diſſimulation, but confeſſe my ſelf perſwaded, that this poor Pamphlet may prove profitable to the young Students of both Laws, to whoſe advancement that way, I have of late addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mine endeavours; elſe were I more than mad to offer it to the world: and to offer it without mention of him, that by occaſioning of this good, more or leſs, deſerveth the prime thanks, were to prove my ſelf unworthy of ſo grave ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>And therefore howſoever I account this too much boldneſs in reſpect of the ſubject: yet could I be exceedingly glad it might pleaſe your Grace to aſcribe mine intention to the integrity of my duty. For he that meaneth truly well, and cannot perform much, muſt needs rejoyce at the good acceptance of that little which he performeth.</p>
            <p>All I crave, for this at your Graces hands, is patience and pardon for this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, with the continuance of thoſe your many favours, that hitherto to my great comfort I have enjoyed. And ſo my long obſervation of your judicious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, having taught me, what ſmall delight you take in affected complements, and verbal commendation, without more words, In all true humbleneſſe, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the Almighty long to continue your Grace in health and proſperity, to his glory, and the good of his Church.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ENTLE Readers, I here offer my ſelf to your cenſures, with no other deſire, than by you to be admoniſhed of my faults. For though I doe profeſſe the amplifying of their works, that have gone before me in this kind, and have both gathered at home, and brought from abroad ſome ornaments for their better imbelliſhing of our Engliſh Laws: yet am I neither ſo vain as to deny my imperfections, nor ſo paſſionate as to be offended at your charitable reformations. Nay my true end is the advancement of knowledge; and therefore have publiſhed this poor work, not only to impart the good thereof to thoſe young ones that want it; but alſo to draw from the learned the ſupply of my defects: and ſo by degrees, if not my ſelf to finiſh this model; yet at leaſt, by the heat of emulation to incenſe ſome skilfuller Architect thereunto. Yea, I ſhall think my pains ſufficiently recompenſed, if they may be found but worthy to ſtir up one learned man to amend mine errors.</p>
            <p>The Civilians of other Nations, have by their mutual induſtries raiſed this kind of work in their profeſſion, to an unexpected excellency. I have ſeen many of them that have bestowed very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and commendable pains therein: And Laſtly, one <hi>Calvinus</hi> a Doctor at <hi>Heidelberge,</hi> like a laborious Bee, hath gathered from all the former, the best juyce of their flowers, and made up a hive full of delectable honie. And by this example would I gladly incite the learned in our Common Laws and Antiquities of <hi>England,</hi> yet to lend their advice, to the gaining of ſome comfortable lights and proſpects towards the beautifying of this antient Palace, that hitherto hath been accounted (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſubſtantial) yet but dark and melancholy.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever will charge theſe my travels with many overſights, he ſhall need no ſolemn pains to prove them; for I will eaſily confeſſe them. And, upon my view taken of this Book, ſithence the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, I dare aſſure them that ſhall obſerve moſt faults therein, that I by gleaning after him, will gather as many omitted by him, as he ſhall ſhew committed by me. But I learned long ſithence out of famous <hi>Tully,</hi> That as no mans errors ought to be followed, becauſe he ſaith ſome things well: ſo that which a man ſaith well is not to be rejected, becauſe he hath ſome errors. No man, no Book is void of imperfections. And therefore reprehend who will, in Gods name: that is with ſweetneſſe, and without reproach. So ſhall he reap hearty thanks at my hands: and by true imitation of the moſt indicious that ever wrote, more ſoundly help on this point of learning to perfection in a few months, than I by toſſing and tumbling my books at home, could poſſibly have done in many years. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath taught me this in my Inſtitutes lately ſet forth: by publiſhing whereof I have gained the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious obſervations of diverſe learned Gentlemen upon them, which by keeping them private I could never have procured. By which means, I hope one day to commend them to you again in a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act purity, and ſo leave them to future times for ſuch acceptance as it ſhall pleaſe God to give them.</p>
            <p>I have is ſome Towardneſſe a Tract <hi>(De Regulis Juris)</hi> wherein my intent is, by collating the caſes of both Laws, to ſhew, that they both be raiſed of one foundation, and differ more in language and terms, than in ſubſtance, and therefore were they reduced to one method, (as they eaſily might) to be attained (in a manner) with all one pains. But my time imparted to theſe ſtudies, being but ſtoln from mine employments of greater neceſsity, I cannot make the haſt I deſire, or perhaps that the diſcourſe may deſerve. Wherefore, untill my leiſure may ſerve to perform that, I intreat you loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to accept this.</p>
            <p>One thing I have done in this Book, whereof becauſe it may ſeem ſtrange to ſome, I think to yeeld my reaſon: and that is the inſerting, not only of words belonging to the art of the Law, but of any other alſo, that I thought obſcure, of what ſort ſoever; as Fiſh, Cloath, Stices, Druggs, Furrs, and ſuch like. For in this I follow the example of our Civilians, that have thought it their part to expound any thing they could meet with in their walk. And indeed a Lawyer profeſſeth true Philoſophy, and therefore ſhould not be ignorant (if it were poſsible) of either beaſts, fowls, or creeping things, nor of the trees from the Cedar in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> to the Hyſſop that ſpringeth out of the wall. And therefore if I have either omitted any hard word within my circuit, or ſet it it down not expounded; I give you good leave to impute the one to my negligence, the other to mine ignorance: and ſo commend theſe my pains to your beſt profit, and you unto God.</p>

                     <hi>Abeyance,</hi> ſeemeth to be derived from (<hi>Abayer.</hi> i. <hi>allatrare</hi>) to bark at as Dogs do againſt a Stranger, or Spaniels at a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant put to the Peark. So children are ſaid <hi>(bayer à la mamme)</hi> when ſeeing the dugge, they ſtruggle and make means towards it. And they likewiſe <hi>(bayer aut Pargent) qui ſpe atque animo incumbunt pecuniae.</hi> This word in <hi>Littleton, cap. Diſcontinuance,</hi> is thus uſed. The right of Fee-ſimple lyeth in abey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: that is (as himſelf interpreteth) all only in the remembrance, intendment, and conſideration of the Law. Alſo in the ſame place, the Frank tenement of the Glebe of the Parſonage, is in no man during the time that the Parſonage is void, but is in abeyance. And again: It is a principle in Law, that of every land there is Fee-ſimple in ſome man, or the Fee-ſimple is in Abeyance. Conſidering theſe places, and comparing them with the ſignification of the French word, I am driven to think, that our antient Lawyers would ſignifie hereby a kind of hope, or longing expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: becauſe that thoſe things that be in abeyance, though for the preſent they be in no man, yet they are in hope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation belonging to him that is next to enjoy them. For I find alſo in the French, that <hi>unbayard,</hi> is <hi>avidus ſpectator,</hi> a greedy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder. I cannot in mine own opinion bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter compare this, than to that which the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians call <hi>Haereditatem jacentem.</hi> For as <hi>Bracton</hi> ſaith (<hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>nu.</hi> 10.) <hi>Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditas jacens nullius eſt bonis ante aditionem.

I am of opinion that the word original ſignifieth a forfeiture, or an amerciament, and that it is much transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the writing, by miſpriſion and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Clarks: thinking it very probable that it proceedeth from the German verb <hi>Beſchetzen,</hi> which is as much as <hi>fiſco addicere vel confiſcere.</hi> It ſeemeth by the former Authors to be tearmed a freedome or liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; becauſe he that hath his word in any Charter or Grant, hath not only the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and amerciaments of all others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his fee or tranſgreſſions, but alſo is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf free from all ſuch controll of any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that compaſs.</p>

                     <hi>Abjuration (abjuratio)</hi> ſignifieth in our common law a ſworn baniſhment; or an oath taken to forſake the Realm for ever. For as <hi>Stawnf. pl. Cor. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 40. ſaith out of <hi>Polydore Virgils</hi> 11 book of Chronicles, the devotion toward the Church, firſt in Saint <hi>Edward</hi> a Saxon King, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in all the reſt, untill <hi>anno</hi> 22 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. was ſo earneſt, that if a man having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted felony, could recover a Church, or
<pb facs="tcp:56626:4"/>Church-yard, before he were apprehended, he might not be thence drawn to the uſual tryal of Law, but confeſſing his fault to the Juſtices at their comming, or to their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner, before them or him give his oath fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to forſake the Realm. Of this you may read a touch, <hi>an.</hi> 7 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. But the form and effect of this you may have in the old Abridgement of Statutes, <hi>titulo</hi> Abjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>nu.</hi> 3. taken out of the antient Tractate, intituled <hi>De officiis Coronatorum,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Cromptons</hi> Tractate of the Office of the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>fo.</hi> 260. <hi>b.</hi> and in the new Book of Entries, <hi>verbo</hi> Abjuration: and in <hi>Andrew Horus</hi> Mirrour of Juſtices, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap. del Office del Coroner.</hi> This part of our Law was in ſome ſort practiſed by the Saxons, as appeareth by the Laws of King <hi>Edward,</hi> ſet out by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Lambert, num.</hi> 10. but more directlie by the Normans, as is evident by the grand Cuſtumary, <hi>ca.</hi> 24. where you have theſe words in effect, He that flieth to a Church or holy place, may ſtay there for eight daies, and at the ninth day he muſt be demanded, whether he will yeeld him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſecular juſtice, or hold him to the Church: for if he will he may yeeld himſelf to the lay Court. If he cleave to the Church, he ſhall foreſwear the Countrie before the Knights and other people of credit, which may witneſs the act, if need require. The form of the Oath is likewiſe there ſet down, with the reſt of the proceeding in this matter, very agreeable with ours. This mercy as well of the Saxons as Normans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived unto us, ſomething reſembleth that of the Roman Emperors towards ſuch as fled to the Church, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Co. titulo</hi> 12. or to the images of themſelves, <hi>eodem, titulo</hi> 25. And alſo that of <hi>Moſes</hi> touching the Cities of refuge, <hi>Exod. cap.</hi> 21. <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>Num. ca.</hi> 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 11, 12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 20. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. But as it was in our Anceſtors daies larger by great oddes, in this Realm, ſo had it leſs reaſon, as may appear to all that will compare them. Of all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances belonging to this abjuration, you may futher read the new Tearms of law, <hi>Stawnford ubi ſupra,</hi> and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But this grew at the laſt upon good reaſon, to be but a perpetual confining of the offender to ſome Sanctuary; wherein, upon abjurarion of his liberty and free habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, he would chooſe to ſpend his life, as appeareth, <hi>an.</hi> 22 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. And this benefit alſo by other Statutes is at the laſt wholly taken away. So that abjurati on at this day hath place but in few places: And if it be inflicted upon any, it is not a confining to a Sanctuary (for there be no Sanctuaries remaining amongſt us) but a ſworn baniſhment of the Kings Dominions. This the Civilians call <hi>exilium,</hi> or <hi>deportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, li.</hi> 28. <hi>Digeſt. tit.</hi> 22. <hi>de interdictis, rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatis, &amp; deportatis.</hi>

But in the Common law it ſeemeth (at the leaſt for the moſt part) to be more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly uſed for making a declaration or count ſhorter, by ſubtracting or ſevering ſome of the ſubſtance therein compriſed.

For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the diviſion of an Inheritance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween co-heirs or co-partners, called in the Civil law <hi>(actio familiae exciſcundae:)</hi> ſecondly, the diviſion of any particular thing being common to more, called like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>(actio de communi dividundo:)</hi> and this kind of action (ſaith <hi>Bracton</hi>) doth ſeem to be mixt, becauſe it lyeth as well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the thing as the perſon: and indeed ſo do other excellent Civilians, as <hi>Cuiacius</hi> and <hi>Weſenbecius</hi> in their Paratitles. <hi>π. finium regund.</hi> And though <hi>Juſtinian</hi> in his firſt diviſion omitteth the third member: yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward in the ſame title, § 20. he ſaith as theſe men do, <hi>viz.</hi> that there be certain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (naming theſe and other of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) that ſeem to have a mixture, &amp;c. Of this you may alſo read <hi>Britton</hi> at large in his Chapter 71. And this diviſion of action ſpringeth from the object or matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about it conſiſteth, <hi>Weſenb. parat. π. de a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio. &amp; obliga.</hi> The Author of the new Tearms of Law defineth a mixt action to be a ſute given by the Law to recover the thing demanded, and alſo the damages for wrong done: as in Aſſiſe of novel diſſeiſin: the which writ, if the diſſeiſour make a feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to another, the diſſeiſeur ſhall have a remedie againſt the diſſeiſour and the feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, or other land tenant, to recover not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the land, but the dammages alſo. See the teſt. Theſe words occaſion me to ſhew, that <hi>actio</hi> is by the Civil law called <hi>mixta</hi> in two reſpects: <hi>Nam quadam mistae ſunt, quòd in ſe, &amp; actionis in rem, &amp; actionis perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis naturam habeant, &amp; in üs, &amp; actor &amp; reus uterque ſit, l. actionis verbo. §. fina w. de obliga. &amp; actio.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Action,</hi> is alſo by the Civilians divided, of the efficient cauſe, <hi>in civilem &amp; praetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.</hi> Whereof one riſeth out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon civil law, the other from ſome Edict of the Pretour. Who being Chief Juſticer, had authority for his year, to ſupply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the general law by his eſpecial e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts. And a diviſion not unlike this may be made in the Common law of England, one growing from the antient cuſtomary law, the other from ſome Statute. <hi>Brook tit. Action ſur le statut.</hi>

                     <hi>Action</hi> of the final cauſe, is divided into <hi>civill, poenal, &amp; mixt. Cook vol.</hi> 6. <hi>fol.</hi> 61. <hi>a.</hi> Action civil is that, which tendeth only to the reeovery of that which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any contract or other like cauſe, is due unto us: as if a man by action ſeek to recover a ſum of mony formerly lent,
<pb facs="tcp:56626:6"/>&amp;c. Action penal is, that aimeth at ſome penalty or puniſhment in the party ſued, be it corporal or pecuniary. As in the Action <hi>legis Aquiliae</hi> in the Civil law: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in our Common law the next Friends of a man feloniouſly ſlain or wounded, ſhall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the law againſt the murtherer, or him that wounded him, to condign puniſhment. <hi>Bract. li.</hi> 3. <hi>ca.</hi> 4. Action mixt is that, which ſeeketh both the thing whereof we are deprived, and a penalty alſo for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt deteining of the ſame: as in an Action of Tithe upon the Statute, <hi>anno</hi> 2 <hi>&amp;</hi> 3 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Action</hi> is alſo, according to the form of Petition, divided into ſuch as are conceived to recover either the ſimple value of the thing chalenged, or the double, the triple, or quadruple. <hi>Bract. li.</hi> 3. <hi>ca.</hi> 3. <hi>nu.</hi> 6. So doth <hi>Decies tantum</hi> lye againſt Embracers. <hi>Fitz. not. br. fol.</hi> 171. and againſt Jurours that take mony for their verdict of one part, or the other, or both. And to be ſhort, any other action upon a Statute that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any offence by reſtitution, or fine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the tranſgreſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Action</hi> is prejudicial (otherwiſe called preparatorie) or elſe principal: prejudicial is that which groweth from ſome queſtion or doubt in the principal: as if a man ſue his younger Brother for Land deſcended from his Father, and it be objected unto him he is a Baſtard. <hi>Bract. lib.</hi> 3, <hi>ca.</hi> 4. <hi>nu.</hi> 6. For this point of baſtardy muſt be tryed before the cauſe can further proceed, and therefore is termed <hi>praejudicialis, quia prius judicanda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Action</hi> is either awnceſtrel, or perſonal. <hi>Stawnf. pl. cor.</hi> 59. Aunceſtrel ſeemeth to be that, which we have by ſome right deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from our Anceſtor upon us: and that perſonall, which hath the beginning in and from our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Action</hi> upon the Caſe <hi>(actio ſuper caſu)</hi> is a general Action given for redreſs of wrongs done without force againſt any man, and by Law not eſpecially provided for. For where you have any occaſion of ſute, that neither hath a fit name, nor certain form al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready preſcribed: there the Clerks of the Chancery in antient time conceived a fit form of Action for the fact in queſtion: which the Civilians call <hi>actionem in factum,</hi> and our common Lawyers, action upon the caſe. <hi>In factum actiones dicuntur ideo, quia quod nomine non poſſunt exprimere negotium, id rei geſta enarratione declarant citra formulam ac ſolennitatem ullam: Cuiacius &amp; Gothofredus ad Rubricam de praeſcriptis verbis.</hi> And whereas in the Civill Law there are two ſorts <hi>(actionis in factum)</hi> one termed <hi>actio in factum ex praeſcriptis verbis,</hi> the other <hi>actio in factum praetoria. Weſenb. parat. de praeſcrip. verb.</hi> the former growing upon words paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in contract, the other more generally upon any, fact touching either contract or offence formerly not provided againſt; this Action upon the Caſe ſeemeth in uſe to be more like to the Pretours Action <hi>in factum,</hi> than to the other: becauſe in the peruſal of the new book of Entries, and <hi>Brooks</hi> his Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hereupon, I perceive that an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the Caſe lyeth as well againſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as breach of contract. Of this ſee more in the word <hi>Treſpaſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Action</hi> upon the Statute <hi>(actio ſuper Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuto)</hi> is an Action brought againſt a man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on breach of a Statute: to be reſembled in mine opinion to any Action given in the law Imperial, either upon <hi>edictum praetoris, ple biſcitum</hi> or <hi>ſenatuſconſultum.</hi> For as the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, ſo the common People <hi>in comitiis tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> and the Senators or Nobility <hi>in curia vel ſenatu,</hi> had power to make laws, whereupon the Pretour or other Judges permitted Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And even ſo our high Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment maketh Statutes againſt ſuch offences, as are either newly grown, or more and more increaſed: and our Judges entertain their Plees, that commence their actions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the breakers of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Action</hi> is perpetual or temporal <hi>(perpetua vel temporalis)</hi> and that is called perpetual, the force whereof is by no time determined. Of which ſort were all civil Actions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the antient Romans, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as grew from Laws, decrees of the Senate, or conſtitutions of the Emperors: whereas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions granted by the Pretor, died within the year, <hi>de perpet. &amp; tempor. actio. in Inſtit.</hi> So we have in <hi>England</hi> perpetual and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary actions: and I think all may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led perpetual, that are not expreſly limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. As divers Statutes give actions, ſo they be purſued within the time by them preſcribed, namely, the Statute <hi>anno</hi> 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. giveth action for three years after the offences therein ſhall be committed, and no longer: and the Statute <hi>anno</hi> 7 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. doth the like for four years; and that <hi>anno</hi> 31 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 5. for one year and no more. But as by the Civil Law no actions were at the laſt ſo perpetual, but that by time
<pb facs="tcp:56626:6"/>they might be preſcribed againſt: as <hi>actiones in rem decem aut viginti terminantur annis, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonales veró triginta. ſect.</hi> 1. <hi>de perpet. &amp; temp. actioin Inſtitutio. &amp; l.</hi> 3. <hi>Co. de praeſcript.</hi> 30. <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum:</hi> ſo in our Common law, though acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be called perpetual in compariſon of thoſe that be expreſly limited by Statute; yet is there a means to preſcribe againſt real actions within five years, by a fine levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or a recovery acknowledged, as you may ſee farther in the word Fine, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. And for this alſo look Limitation of Aſſiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Action</hi> is farther divided, <hi>in actionem bonae fidei &amp; ſtricti juris.</hi> Which diviſion hath good uſe in our common Law like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, though the terms I find not in any of their Writers. But of this, and ſuch like diviſions, becauſe they have as yet no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent acceptance amongſt our Lawyers, but only a hidden uſe, I refer the Reader to the Civilians, and namely to <hi>Weſenb.</hi> in his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles. <hi>

Howſoever the ſignification of this word grew to be reſtrained amongſt us, it greatly booteth not.

<pb facs="tcp:56626:7"/>authorize them as fully as Executors, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up, and to diſpoſe the Goods of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed: alway provided, that they ſhould be accountable for the ſame, as Executors.

And I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf that the committing of this burden unto Biſhops, and thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive Eccleſiaſtical Authority from them, grew firſt from the conſtitution of <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperor. <hi>Co. de Epiſco. et cleri. l. nulli li licere.</hi> 28.

Neither do I find any ſuch Officer belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Emperors in our Code. And <hi>M.

Take his words: If the pledges for ſuch a treſpaſſe (ſaith he) do appear by common ſummons, but not the defendant himſelf, then the pledges ſhall be impriſoned, for that default of the defendant: but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is, if the defendant himſelf doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and be ready in Court before the Lord Juſtice in <hi>eyr,</hi> to receive his judgement, and to pay his fine.

The Author of the new terms of law, ſaith, that amercia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is moſt properly a penaltie aſſeſſed, by the peers or equals of the partie amercied for an offence done, for the which he putteth himſelf upon the mercy of the Lord.

The ſecond difference is, that for the recovery of an Annuity, no Action lyeth, but only the Writ of Annuity againſt the Granter, his Heirs or Succeſſors: but of a Rent, the ſame Actions lye as do of Land, as the Caſe requireth. The third difference is, that an Annuity is never taken for Aſſets, becauſe it is no Free-hold in law, neither ſhall be put in execution upon a Statute Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, Statute Staple, or Elegit, as a Rent may. <hi>Dyer fol.</hi> 345. <hi>num.</hi> 2. ſpeaketh alſo to this effect.</p>

                  <p>The Judge of this Court is termed the Dean of the Arches, or the Official of the Arches Court. Dean of the Arches, becauſe with this officialty, is commonly joined a peculiar Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of thirteen Pariſhes in <hi>Londor,</hi> ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Deanrie, being exempted from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and belonging to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> of which the Pariſh of <hi>Bow</hi> is one and the chief, becauſe the Court is there kept. Some others ſay, that he was firſt called <hi>Dean of the Arches,</hi> becauſe the official to the Archbiſhop, being many times imployed abroad, in Ambaſſages for the King and Realm, the Dean of the Arches was his Subſtitute in his Court, and by that means the names became confounded. The juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction of this Judge is ordinary, and extendeth it ſelf thorow the whole Province of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bnry.</hi> So that upon any Appeal made, he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with and without any further examination of the Cauſe, ſendeth out his Citation to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty appealed, and his inhibition to the Judge from whom the Appeal is made.

And albeit it were not out of the way, to think that it is called an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, becauſe it ſtayeth or arreſteth the party; yet I believe rather, that we receive the ſame from the Norman laws, becauſe we uſe it in the ſame ſence with them. For commonly with us, an arreſt is taken for the excution of the Commandement of ſome Court, or of ſome Officer in juſtice. But howſoever the name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, an arreſt is a certain reſtraint of a mans perſon, depriving him of his own will and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and binding it to become obedient to the will of the Law, and it may be called the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of impriſonment.

                     <hi>Aſsiſe (aſsiſa)</hi> commeth of the French word <hi>aſsiſe,</hi> which in the grand Cuſtomary of Normandy, <hi>c.</hi> 24. is defined to this effect: <hi>Aſsiſe</hi> is an Aſſembly of Knights and other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial men, with the Bailiff or Iuſtice, in a certain place, and at a ceptain time appointed. And again, <hi>c.</hi> 55. <hi>Aſsiſe</hi> is a Court, in the which whatſoever is done, ought to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſtrength. This Norman word <hi>aſsiſe,</hi> commeth of the French <hi>aſſeoire,</hi> i. <hi>collocare,</hi> to ſettle or beſtow in ſome place certain: as <hi>S'aſſeoir,</hi> is to fit down by another. And me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically it is uſed of things incorporeal, as <hi>aſſeoir ſon jugement ſur quel que lieu,</hi> is, <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponere judicium ſuum.</hi> Of this Verb commeth the Participle <hi>aſsis,</hi> as <hi>estre aſsis,</hi> i. <hi>ſedere.</hi> And this Participle in the grand Cuſtomary of Normandy, <hi>c.</hi> 68. is uſed as we would ſay, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, limited, or determined, <hi>viz. au jour qui est aſsis àfaire la battaille, ſe doibuent les champions offrir à la justice;</hi> That is, At the day which is appointed for the combat, the Champions ought to offer themſelves to the Iuſtice. So that by all theſe places compared together, it is evident whence the original of this word <hi>aſsiſe</hi> floweth. How diverſly it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in our Common law, it followeth that we declare. Firſt, <hi>Littleton</hi> in the Chapter <hi>Rents</hi> ſaith, that it is <hi>aequivocum:</hi> where he ſetteth down three ſeveral ſignifications of it; one, as it is taken for a Writ: another, as it is uſed for a Iury: the third, as for an Ordinance. And him, he that liſteth may read more at large.

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they were originally ſped and executed at a certain time and place formerly appointed. For by the Norman law, the time and place muſt be known forty days before the Iuſtices ſate of them: and by our Law there muſt be likewiſe fifteen daies of preparation, except they be tryed in thoſe ſtanding Courts of the King in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as appeareth by <hi>F. N. B. fo.</hi> 177. <hi>d, e.</hi> Laſtly, they may be called Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſes; becauſe they are tryed moſt commonly by eſpecial Courts, ſet and appointed for the purpoſe, as may be well proved not only out of the Cuſtomary of Normandy, but our books alſo: which ſhew, that in antient times Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices were appointed by ſpecial Commiſſion, to diſpatch controverſies of poſſeſſion, one or more, in this or that only County, as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fell out, or diſſeiſins were offered, and that as well in Term time, as out of Term: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as of later daies, we ſee that all theſe Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Aſſiſes, of <hi>Eyr,</hi> of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> of <hi>Gaol-delivery,</hi> and of <hi>Niſi prius,</hi> are diſpatched all at one time, by two ſeveral Circuits in the year, out of term, and by ſuch as have the greateſt ſway of Iuſtice, being all of them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Kings ordinary Iuſtices of his Benches, Sergeants at the Law, or ſuch like.</p>

And yet the Iury ſummoned upon a Writ of right, is likewiſe called the Aſſiſe, as himſelf there confeſſeth. Which writ of right is not an Aſſiſe: but this may be ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">

For this place thus much in ſhort. The former four kinds of Aſſiſes uſed in actions only poſſeſſory, be called petit aſſiſes, in reſpect of the grand Aſſiſe.

Item vertitur aſſiſa &amp; ſeq.</hi> And note, that aſſiſe in this ſignification, is taken four waies, <hi>Old nat. br. fol.</hi> 105. The firſt is aſſiſe at large, which is taken as well upon other points, as upon the diſſeiſin. For example, where an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant bringeth an aſsiſe, and the deed of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor is pleaded, whereby he claimeth his right or foundeth his title, then the aſſiſe ſhall be taken at large: that is, the Jury ſhall enquire not only whether the Plaintiff were diſſeiſed or not by the Tenent, but alſo of theſe two points: <hi>viz.</hi> whether his anceſtor were of full age, of good memory, and out of Priſon, when he made the Deed pleaded. Another example out of <hi>Kitchin, fol.</hi> 66. The Tenent pleadeth a forein releaſe, in bar to an aſsiſe, whereupon the cauſe was adjourned. At the day the Tenent maketh default. Therefore the aſsiſe was taken at large: that is, not only whether the Plaintiff were diſſeiſed, but alſo whether there be any forein releaſe. A third example you may read in <hi>Littleton, c. Eſtates upon Condition.</hi> The ſecond manner of aſſiſe in point of aſſiſe <hi>(aſsiſa in modum aſsiſae)</hi> which is, when the Tenent, as it were ſetting foot to foot with the Demandant, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther circumſtance, pleadeth directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Writ, no wrong, no diſſeiſin. The third manner is, aſſiſe out of the point of aſſiſe <hi>(aſsiſa extra aſsiſam, velin modum jurata) viz.</hi> when the Tenent allegeth ſome by exception, that muſt be tryed by a Jury, before the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſe can proceed: as if he plead a forein releaſe, or forein matter tryable in another County. For in this caſe, the Juſtices refer the Record to the Court of Common pleas, for the Tryal of the Forein pleas, before the diſſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin can come to be decuſſed. Of this ſort read divers others examples in <hi>Bracton l.</hi> 4. <hi>parte</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 34. For there be of them (as he ſaith) and <hi>Britten</hi> alſo, <hi>c.</hi> 52. both dilatory and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, The fourth and laſt manner is: Aſsiſe of right of dammages, and that is, when the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent confeſsing a putting out, and referring it to a demurrer in Law, whether it were rightly done or not, is adjudged to have done wrong. For then ſhall the Demandant have a Writ to recover dammages, which is called aſsiſe to recover dammages, as alſo the whole proceſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſsiſe,</hi> is further taken for the Court, place, or time, when and where the Writs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
<pb facs="tcp:56626:14"/>of the aſſiſe be handled or taken. And in this ſignification aſſiſe is general: as when the Juſtices paſs their ſeveral Circuits, every couple with their Commiſsion, to take all aſſiſes twice in the year. For he that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of any thing done, at that time, and in that place, will commonly ſay, that it was done at the general aſſiſe. It may likewiſe be ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, in this ſignification: as if an eſpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſhould be granted to certain (as in anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times they often were, <hi>Bracton lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>in fine</hi>) for the taking of an aſſiſe upon one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſin or two: any thing done in the Court before them, a man would ſay, it was done at ſuch an eſpecial aſſiſe.

And <hi>M. Lambert</hi> in his <hi>Eirenarch, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. maketh this difference between an Arreſt and an Attachment: that an arreſt proceedeth out of lower Courts by Precept, and an attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of higher Courts by Precept or Writ: and that a Precept to arreſt, hath theſe formal words <hi>(ducifacias, &amp;c.)</hi> and a Writ of attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment theſe words <hi>(praecipimus tibi quòd atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies talem, &amp; habeas cum coram nobis, &amp;c.)</hi> whereby it appeareth, that he which arreſteth, carrieth the party arreſted to another higher Perſon to be diſpoſed of forthwith, he that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacheth, keepeth the Party attached, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth him in Court at the day aſſigned in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment. Yet I obſerve out of <hi>Maſter Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin,</hi> that an attachment iſſueth out of a Court Baron, which is a low Court, <hi>cap. Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Court Baron, fol.</hi> 79. Another difference there is, that an arreſt lyeth only upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a man, and an attachment ſometime up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his goods, as ſhall be ſhewed in the ſequel. It may be likewiſe asked how an attachment and a <hi>(capias)</hi> do differ: and how an attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and a <hi>(cape)</hi> and an attachment and a Diſtreſs. Firſt, that an attachment differeth from a <hi>(capias)</hi> it appeareth by <hi>Kitchin</hi> in theſe words: <hi>fol.</hi> 79. Note that in a Court Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron a man ſhall be attached by his goods; and a <hi>(capias)</hi> ſhall not go out thence: whereby I gather, that an attachment is more general, taking hold of a mans goods, and a <hi>(capias)</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:56626:15"/>his body only. Then an attachment differeth from a <hi>(cape)</hi> in this, becauſe a <hi>(cape)</hi> be it <hi>(cape magnum)</hi> or <hi>(cape parvum)</hi> taketh hold of immoveables, as Lands or Tenements, and are properly belonging to action real: as you may gather out of their forms, in <hi>Fitzh. nat. br.</hi> whereas attachment hath rather place in Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons perſonal, as <hi>Bracton</hi> plainly ſetteth down, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>tract.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>num.</hi> 3. Where never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it appeareth, that a <hi>(cape)</hi> may be likewiſe uſed in an Action perſonal. An at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment (as is formerly ſaid) taketh hold of moveable goods, or the body. For it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by <hi>Kitchin, fol.</hi> 263. that a man may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached by an hundred Sheep. Read <hi>Skene, de verbo ſignif. verbo Attachiamentum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it followeth to ſhew how Attachment differeth from a Diſtreſs. For ſo it doth, as may be ſhewed out of <hi>Kitchin, fol.</hi> 78. where he ſaith, that Proceſs in Court Baron, is Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Attachment, and Diſtreſs, our of the <hi>Old nat. br. fol.</hi> 27. where it is ſaid, that a Proceſs in a <hi>(quare impedit)</hi> is Summons, Attachment, and one Diſtreſs, and again, <hi>fol.</hi> 28. where ſpeaking of the Writ <hi>Ne admittas</hi>) he ſaith thus: And the Proceſs is one prohibition; and upon the prohibition an Attatchment or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; and <hi>fol.</hi> 32. in a Writ of <hi>(Indicavit)</hi> you have theſe words: And after the attachment returned, the Diſtreſs ſhall go out of the Roles of the Juſtices. <hi>Bracton</hi> on the other ſide, <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>tract.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>num.</hi> 2. ſheweth, that both <hi>(at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachiamentum, &amp; magnum cape, diſtrictiones ſunt.)</hi> Of which opinion <hi>Fleta</hi> alſo is, <hi>li.</hi> 5. <hi>ca.</hi> 24. <hi>§. ſi autem aed.</hi> But there alſo he ſaith, that <hi>(attachiamentum eſt diſtrictio perſonalis, &amp; cape magnum diſtrictio realis.)</hi> So that by his opinion, <hi>diſtrictio</hi> is <hi>(genus)</hi> to Attachment. <hi>Britton</hi> in his 26 Chapter, hath words to this effect: But in Attachment of Felony, there commeth no Diſtreſs, otherwiſe than by the body. And if the Sheriff return in the caſes aforeſaid, that the Treſpaſſours have nothing in his Bayliwick, by the which they may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreined, it muſt be awarded that he take their bodies &amp;c. In which place, an Attachment is plainly uſed, for an apprehenſion of an Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by his goods. So that to conclude, I find no difference between an Attachment, and a Diſtreſs, but theſe two: That an Attachment reacheth not to Lands, as a Diſtreſs doth; and that a Diſtreſs toucheth not the body (if it be properly taken) as an attachment doth. Yet are they divers times confounded, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the places formerly alleged, and by <hi>Glanvil. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. and <hi>Fleta lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 66. <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi> Howbeit, in the moſt common uſe, an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment is an apprehenſion of a man by his Body, to bring him to anſwer the action of the Plaintiff: a Diſtreſs is the taking of another mans goods, for ſome real cauſe, as rent, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or ſuch like, whereby to drive him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plevy, and ſo to be Plaintiff in an action of Treſpaſs, againſt him that diſtreined him. And ſo much for the difference, and coherence of theſe words. See alſo Diſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>I find in <hi>Weſt. parte</hi> 2. <hi>ſymbolaio. titulo</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in Chancery, <hi>ſect.</hi> 22, 23. that At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment out of the Chancery is two-fold, one ſimple, and originally decreed for the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the party: the other, after return made by the Sheriff, <hi>Quod defendens non eſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventus in Baliva ſua,</hi> with Proclamations made through the whole County, in ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as he ſhall think meet, that the party appear by a day aſſigned, and that he be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatched nevertheleſs, if he may be found. This ſecond kind hath an affinity with the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts <hi>(viis &amp; modis)</hi> at the which if the Party appear not, he is excommunicate: or with the Civilians <hi>viis &amp; modisunà cum intimatione</hi> for in the Chancery, if he come not upon this, he is forthwith preſſed with a Writ of rebellion.</p>
                  <p>There is an attachment of Privilege, which is a power to apprehend a man in a privileged place, or elſe, by vertue of a mans privilege, to call another to this or that Court, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he himſelf belongeth, and in reſpect whereof he is privileged.

There is alſo an attachment of the Foreſt, which is a Court there held. For as (<hi>M.

The original of this Court was, becauſe the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> heard many Cauſes extrajudicially at home in his own Palace, in which, before he would fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally determine any thing, he did uſually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to be diſcuſſed by certain learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men in the Civil and Canon laws, whom thereupon be termed his Auditors. And ſo in time it grew to one eſpecial man, who at this day is called <hi>(Cauſarum negotiorum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que audientiae Cantuarienſis anditoriſeu officialis.)</hi> And with this Office hath heretoſore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly been joined the Chancerie of the Arch-Biſhop, who medleth not in any point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious? Juriſdiction, that is, deciding of Cauſes between party and party (except ſuch as are ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated <hi>pro forma</hi> only, as the confirmation of Biſhops Elections, or ſuch like) but only of Office, and eſpecially ſuch as are <hi>voluntariae juriſdictionis,</hi> as the granting of the cuſtodie of the Spiritualities, during the vacation of Biſhopricks, Inſtitutions to Benefices, diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing with Banes of Matrimonie, and ſuch like.

And in this reſpect it may be probably conjectured, that it is ſo called, becauſe it is of more weight than the other. Then alſo it ſignifieth ſuch merchandiſe as are weighed by this weight, and not by Troy weight, as in the ſtatute of York, <hi>anno</hi> 9 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>in proaem. anno</hi> 27 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>ſtatut.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp; anno</hi> 2 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.

                     <hi>BAcheler (bachalaureus)</hi> cometh of the French <hi>bachalier,</hi> i. <hi>tyro:</hi> and thereupon I think, thoſe that be called Bachelers of the companies in London, be ſuch of eath compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as be ſpringing towards the eſtate of thoſe

I have read in an old monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this word Bacheler attributed to the Lord Admiral of England, if he be under a Baron, in French words to this effect: And it is to weet, that when the Admiral rideth to aſſemble a ſhip of war or other, for the buſineſs and affairs of the realm, if he be a Bacheler, he ſhall take for his dayes wages 4 <abbr>s.</abbr> ſterling: if he bean Earl or Baron, he ſhall take wages af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the rate of his eſtate and degree.

For there he is alwayes accounted by the Law, to be in their ward and cuſtody for the time. And they may if they will, keep him in ward or in Priſon at that time, or otherwiſe at their will.

Baſe Tenents be they (as M. <hi>Lamberd</hi> ſaith in his explica. of Saxon words, <hi>verb. Paganus</hi>) which do to their Lords villanous ſervice. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Terms of law in his Tractat of old Terms, ſaith, that to hold in fee baſe, is to hold at the will of the Lord. <hi>Kitchin, fol.</hi> 41. ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to make baſe tenure and franck to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries: where it appeareth, that he putteth Copy-holders in the number of baſe Tenents. And out of theſe, I think, that it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conjectured, that every baſe Tenent hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth at the wil of the Lord, but yet, that ther is a difference between a baſe eſtate and villenage; which <hi>Fitzh.</hi> in his <hi>nat. br. f.</hi> 12. <hi>B. C.</hi> ſeemeth co confound. For the above-named Author of the Terms of law ſaith in the place before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that to hold in pure villenage, is to doe all that the Lord will command him. So that if a Copy-holder have but baſe eſtate, he not hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the performance of every commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Lord, cannot be ſaid to hold in villenage. Whether it may be ſaid, that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-holders be by cuſtome and continuance of time, grown out of that extreme ſervitude, wherein they were firſt created, I leave to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of better judgement: but <hi>Fitz. loco citato</hi> ſaith, tenure by Copie is a Term but lately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>

Baſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atdy ſpecial, is a ſute commenced in the Kings Court, againſt him that calleth another Baſtard: ſo termed (as it ſeemeth) becauſe Baſtardy is the principall and eſpeciall caſe in trial, and no inheritance contended for. And by this it appeareth, that in both theſe fignifications, Baſtardy is rather taken for an examination or triall, whether a mans birth be defective or ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate, than for Baſtardy it ſelf.

                     <hi>Cape</hi> is a writ judicial touching plee of land or tenements, ſo termed (as moſt writs be) of that word in it ſelf, which carrieth the eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialleſt intention or end thereof. And this writ is divided in <hi>(Cape magnum, &amp; cape par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum:)</hi> both which (as is before ſaid in Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) take hold of things immoveable, and ſeem to differ between themſelves in theſe points. Firſt, becauſe <hi>(cape magnum)</hi> or the <hi>(grand Cape)</hi> lyeth before appearance, and <hi>(Cape parvum)</hi> afterward. Secondly, the <hi>(Cape magnum)</hi> ſummoneth the Tenent to anſwer to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, and over to the demandant: <hi>(Cape par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum)</hi> ſummoneth the Tenent to anſwer to the default onely: and therefore is called <hi>(Cape par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum)</hi> or in French Engliſh <hi>(petit Cape.)

This writ is a judicial, and lyeth where a man hath brought a <hi>(Principe quod reddat)</hi> of a thing that toucheth plee of land, and the Tenant make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault at the day to him given in the Writ origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, then this writ ſhall go for the King, to take the land in o the Kings hands: and if he come not at the day given him by the <hi>(grand Cape)</hi> he hath loſt his land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Preſident and form of this writ you may ſee in the Regiſter judicial, <hi>fol.</hi> 1. <hi>b.</hi> It ſeemeth after a ſort to contain in it the effect <hi>(miſsionis in poſſeſſionem ex primo &amp; ſecundo decreto)</hi> among the Civilians. For as the firſt decree, ſeiſeth the thing, and the ſecond giveth it from him, that the ſecond time defaulteth in his appearance, ſo this <hi>(Cape)</hi> both ſeiſeth the land, and alſo aſſigneth to the party a farther day of appearance, at which if he come not in, the land is forfeited. Yet is there dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between theſe two courſes of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Common law firſt, for that <hi>(miſſio in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſionem)</hi> toucheth both mooveable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooveable goods, whereas the <hi>(Cape)</hi> is extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely to immoveable: ſecondly, that the party being ſatisfied of his demand, the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manet</hi> is reſtored to him that defaulted: but by the (<hi>Cape</hi> all is ſeiſed without reſtitution: thirdly, <hi>(miſſio in poſſeſſ:)</hi> is to the uſe of the party agent, the <hi>(Cape)</hi> is to the uſe of the King.

For the King may give or alienate a Foreſt to a ſubject, yet ſo, as when it is once in the ſubject, it leeſeth the true property of a Foreſt: becauſe that the Courts, called the Juſtice ſeat, the Swain more, and Attachment, forthwith do vaniſh; none being able to make a Lord chief Juſtice in <hi>Eyr</hi> of the Foreſt, but the King: as M. <hi>Manwood</hi> well ſheweth, <hi>parte</hi> 2. of his Foreſt Lawes, <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. And yet it may be granted in ſo large a manner, that there

So that a Chaſe differeth from a Foreſt in this, becauſe it may be in the hands of a ſubject, which a Foreſt in his proper &amp; true nature cannot: and from a Park, in that that it is not incloſed, &amp; hath not onely a larger compaſſe and more ſtore of game, but of Keepers alſo and Overſeers.

And the dayes of ſuch ſervice ſeem to have been rated by the quantity of the land ſo holden: as if it extend to a whole Knights fee, then the Tenent was bound thus to follow his Lord fortie dayes. And a Knights ſee, was ſo much land, as in thoſe dayes was accounted a ſufficient living for a Knight: and that was 680 acres, as ſome opinion is, or 800. as others think: or 15 pounds <hi>per annum.

For where ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by preſcription or compoſition, there be Archdeacons that have juriſdiction within their Archdeaconries, as in moſt places they there have, this commiſſary is but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, and moſt commonly doth rather vex and diſturb the Country for his lucre, than of conſcience ſeek to redreſſe the lives of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.

                     <hi>Conjuration (conjuratio)</hi> is the very French word drawn from the Latine; which, as it is compounded of <hi>(con &amp; juro)</hi> ſo it ſignifieth, a compact or plot, made by men combining themſelves together by oath or promiſe, to do ſome publick harm. But in our Common law, it is eſpecially uſed for ſuch as have perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conference with the Devil or evil ſpirit, to know any ſecret, or to affect any purpoſe, <hi>anno</hi> 5 <hi>Elizab. cap.</hi> 16. And the difference that I have obſerved (how truly, let thoſe judge that be better skilled in theſe matters) between conjuration and witchcraft, is becauſe the one ſeemeth, by prayers and invocation of Gods powerful names, to compel the devil, to ſay or do what he commandeth him: the other deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth rather by friendly and voluntary conference or agreement between him or her and the devil or familiar, to have her or his deſires and turns ſerved in lieu of blood, or other gift offered unto him eſpecially of his or her ſoul. And both theſe differ from inchantments or ſorceries, becauſe they are perſonal conferences with the Devil, as is ſaid: but theſe are but medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines and ceremonial forms of words (called commonly charms) without apparition.</p>

So that if a Cople-holder break not the cuſtome of the Manor, and thereby forfeit his Tenure, he ſeemeth not ſo much to ſtand at the Lords courteſie for his right, that he may be diſplaced hand over head at his pleaſure. Theſe cuſtomes of Manor be infinite, varying in one point or other, almoſt in every ſeveral Manor.

                     <hi>Court of Requeſts (curia requestarum)</hi> is a Court of equity, of the ſame nature with the Chancerie, principally inſtituted for the help of ſuch petitioners, as in conſcionable caſes deal by ſupplication with his Majeſtie. This Court, as M. <hi>Gwin</hi> ſaith, in the Preface to his Readings, had beginning from Commiſſion firſt granted by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth to the Maſters of Requeſts: whereas before that time (by his opinion) they had no warrant of ordinary juriſdiction, but travelled between the King and the Petitioner by direction from the Kings mouth. But Sir <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> in a Tractate of his, painfully and very judiciouſly gathered from the Records of the ſame Court, plainly ſheweth that this Court was 9 <hi>Henrici ſeptimi,</hi> though then following the King, and not ſetled in any certain place, neither ſwayed particularly by the Maſters of Requeſts (as now it is) but more at large by others of the Kings moſt Honourable Councel, whom he pleaſed to employ in this ſervice. For <hi>page</hi> 148. of the ſaid Tractate, you have the form of the oath then miniſtred to thoſe that were Judges in this Court: and <hi>à pag. pri. uſque ad pag.</hi> 46. cauſes of divers natures, which in the ſaid Kings dayes, were there handled and adjudged. This Court, as that right honourable and Learned Knight, in a Brief of his upon the ſame Court plainly proveth, was and is parcel of the Kings moſt honoutable Councel, and ſo alwayes called and eſteemed. The Judges thereof were alwayes of the Kings moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Councel, appointed by the King to keep his Councel board. The keeping of this Court was never tyed to any place certain, but onely where the Counſel ſate, the ſuters were to attend. But now of late for the eaſe of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it hath been kept in the White-Hall at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and onely in Term time. It is a Court of Record, wherein Recognizances are alſo taken by the Kings Councel. The form of proceeding in this Court, was altogether ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb facs="tcp:56626:41"/>to the proceſſe of ſummarie cauſes in the Civil Law. The perſons Plaintiffs, and Defendants, were alwayes either privileged, as officers of the Court, or their ſervants, or as the Kings ſervants; or as neceſſary Attendants of them: or elſe where the Plaintiffs poverty, or mean eſtate was not matchable with the wealth or greatneſſe of the Defendant: or where the cauſe meerly contained matter of Equity, and had no proper remedie at the Common law: or where it was ſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended from the King to the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Councel: or concerned Univerſities, Colleges, Hoſpitals, and the like. The cauſes wherewith they deal, and whereof they judge are of all ſorts: as <hi>Maritine, Ultra Marine,</hi> Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, Temporal; But properly Temporal cauſes, and onely of the other ſort, as they are mixt with Temporal. The manner of proceeding in the ſaid Court, is firſt, by Privy Seal, Letters Miſſive, or Injunction, or Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or Bond. Secondly, By Attachement. Thirdly, by Proclamation of Rebellion. Fourthly, by Commiſſion of Rebellion. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by Sergeant at Arms. The effect of the Defendants apparence is, that he attend <hi>De die in diem</hi> on the Councel, till he have mad his anſwer to the Plaintiffs Bill, and be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed to depart upon caution <hi>De judicio ſiſti &amp; judicato ſolvendo,</hi> and Conſtitution of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney and Councel by name. The authority of this Court is ſuch, as upon cauſe to graunt injunctions for barring the Defendant from ſuing the Plaintiff at the Common law: and to ſtay the ſute at the Common law before commencement, and not to arreſt the body of the Plaintiff till further order be taken by the Kings Councel; and the execution of a Decree in this Court may be done, either by impriſonment of the perſon diſobeying, being party, or claiming, under the party: or by levy of the ſumme adjudged upon his Lands.</p>

The effect whereof, is that the ſaid Arch-biſhop taking knowledge of ſuch delay, directeth his Letters under his authentical Seal, to all ſingular Clerks of his Province, thereby commanding and authorizing them and every of them, to admoniſh the ſaid Ordinatie, within a certain number of dayes, namely 9 dayes, to do the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice required, or otherwiſe to cite him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before him or his Official, at a day in the ſaid Letters prefixed, and there to allege the cauſe of his delay.

                     <hi>Dower (dos)</hi> cometh of the French <hi>(dovaire)</hi> and ſignifieth in our Common law, two things: firſt, that which the VVife bringeth to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in marriage, otherwiſe called <hi>(maritagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um)</hi> marriage good: next, and more common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that which ſhe hath of her Husband, after the marriage determined, if ſhe out-live him. <hi>Glanvile lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Bracton, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 38. <hi>Britton. cap.</hi> 101. <hi>in princ.</hi> And in <hi>Scotland, (dos)</hi> ſignifieth juſt as much. <hi>Skene de verb. ſignif. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo Dos.</hi> The former is in French called <hi>(dot)</hi> the other <hi>dovayre</hi> &amp; by them latined <hi>doarium.</hi> I like wiſe once thought it not unreaſonable, to call the former a <hi>Dowrie,</hi> and the other a <hi>Dower:</hi> but I finde them confounded. For example: <hi>Smith de rep. Anglo. pa.</hi> 105. calleth the latter a <hi>dowry,</hi> and <hi>dower</hi> is ſometime uſed for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: as in <hi>Britton ubi ſupra.</hi> Yet were it not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient to diſtinguiſh them being ſo divers. The Civilians cal the former <hi>(dotem)</hi> &amp; the latter <hi>(donationem propter nuptias.)</hi> Of the former, the Common law-books ſpeak very little. This onely is to be noted, that whereas by the Civil Law, inſtruments are made before marriage, which contain the quantity of the wives dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or ſubſtance brought to her husband, that he having the uſe of it, during marriage, may, after certain deductions, reſtore it again to his Wives Heirs or Friends, after the marriage diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved: the Common law of <hi>England,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever chattels, moveable or immoveable, or ready money ſhe bringeth, doth make them forthwith her Husbands own, to be diſpoſed of, as he will, leaving her at his courteſie, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow any thing or nothing of her at his death. The reaſon whereof is ſaid to be, the holding of the Wife in obedience to her Husband. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if ſhe be an inheretrice, her Husband holdeth the Land but during her life, except he have iſſue by her: but then he holdeth it by the courteſie of <hi>England</hi> during his own life. See <hi>Courteſie.</hi> And again, if he have any Land in Fee, whereof he was poſſeſſed during the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, ſhe is to have a third thereof during her life, though ſhe bring nothing to him, except ſhe do by fine releaſe her right, during the marriage. So that here is no great matter to be ſpoken of, but touching <hi>dower</hi> in the latter ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification. You muſt know therefore, that upon ſpeech of marriage between two, the Parents of both ſides are commonly more careful in providing each for his child, than the parties themſelves: And that by their means there be divers bargains made, ſometime for the conveiance of Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to them and their iſſue: And this is ſaid to be given in Frank ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: ſometime to her, during her life and that before, or at the marriage: If before marriage, then it is called a Joynture. For a Joynture is a Covenant, whereby the Husband, or ſome for him, is tyed <hi>(ratione juncturae)</hi> in conſideration of the marriage, that the wife ſurviving him, ſhall have during her life, this or that Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Lands, or thus much Rent, yeerly pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able out of ſuch Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with clauſe of diſtreſſe: and this may be more or leſſe, as they do accord, <hi>Britton, cap.</hi> 110. whom read alſo, <hi>cap.</hi> 102, 103, 104. for <hi>conventio vincit legem.

                     </hi> in the Preface to his Readings thus ſpeaketh. The Court of the Dutchy (or County Palatine of Lancaſter) grew out of the grant of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, who firſt gave the Dutchy to his Son <hi>John of Gaunt,</hi> and endowed it with ſuch Royal right, as the County Palatine of <hi>Cheſter</hi> had: And for as much, as it was afterward extinct in the perſon of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, by reaſon of the union of it with the Crown, the ſame King ſuſpecting himſelf to be more rightfully Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> than King of <hi>England,</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſave his right in the <hi>Dutchy</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould befall of the Kingdome: and therefore he ſeparated the <hi>Dutchy</hi> from the Crown, and ſetled it ſo in the natural perſons of himſelf and his Heirs, as if he had been no King or Politick body at all: In which plight is continued, during the reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth that were deſcended of him. But when King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth had by recovery of the Crown) recontinued the right of the houſe of <hi>York,</hi> he ſeared not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate that <hi>Dutchy</hi> to the Crown again: and yet ſo, that he ſuffered the Court and Officers to remain as he found them. And in this manner, it came together with the Crown, to King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, who liking well of that Policy of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth (by whoſe right alſo he obtained the Kingdom) made like ſeparation of the <hi>Dutchy,</hi> as he had done, and ſo left it to his poſterity, which do yet injoy it.</p>

It is an accuſation, becauſe the Jury that inquireth of the offence, doth not receive it until the party that offereth the Bill, appear ſo farre in it, as to ſubſcribe his name, and offereth his oath for the truth thereof. It differeth from an Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this, that the preferrer of the Bill is no way tyed to the proof thereof upon any penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if it be not pround, except there appear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy.

For example, he that by Charter is made Denizen of <hi>England,</hi> is ſaid to be infranchiſed; and ſo is he that is made a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> or other City, or Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſe of any Town Corporate, becauſe he is made partaker of thoſe liberties that appertain to the Corporation, whereinto he is infran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed.

And that is the <hi>Enqueſt</hi> of Jurors, or by Jurie, which is the moſt uſual trial of all cauſes, both Civil and Criminal in our realm. For in cauſes Civil, after proof is made on either ſide, ſo much as each party thinketh good for himſelf, if the doubt be in the fact, it is referred to the diſcretion of twelve indifferent men, empaneled by the Sheriff for the purpoſe: and as they bring in their Verdict, ſo judgement paſſeth. For the Judge faith, the Jurie findeth the fact thus: then is the Law thus: and ſo we judge. For the Enqueſt in cauſes criminal, ſee <hi>Jurie;</hi> and ſee Sir <hi>Thomas Smith de Repub.

For example, two ſeveral perſons, being found Heirs to Land, by two ſeveral of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in one Countie, the King is brought in doubt to whether livery ought to be made: and therefore before Livery be made to either, they muſt enterplead; that is, formerly trie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themſelves, who is the right Heir. <hi>Stawnf. praeroga. cap.</hi> 12.

And in this place of entrie there be three degrees: The firſt is, where a man demandeth Land or Tenements of his own ſeiſin, after the Term is expired. The ſecond is where one demandeth Lands or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements, let by another, after the Term expired. The third, where one demandeth Lands or Tenements of that Tenent, that had entry by one, to whom ſome Anceſtor of the Plaintiff did let it for a Term now expired. According to which degrees, the Writs for more fit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy are varied. And there is yet a fourth form, which is withour degrees, and in caſe of a more remote Seiſin, whereunto the other three degrees do not extend. The Writ in the ſecond degree is called a VVrit of entry <hi>in le per:</hi> and a VVrit in the third degree is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a VVrit of entry <hi>in le per &amp; cui:</hi> and the fourth form without theſe degrees, is called a VVrit of entry <hi>in le poſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </hi> that is to ſay, after the diſſeiſin which ſuch a one made to ſuch a one.

                     <hi>Fee (Feodum, aliàs Feudum)</hi> cometh of the French (<hi>fief,</hi> i. <hi>praedium beneficiarum, vel res cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extelaris</hi>) and is uſed in our Common law, for all thoſe lands which we hold by perpetual right: as <hi>Hotoman</hi> well noteth, <hi>verb. Feodum, de verbis feudalibus.</hi> Our ancient Lawyers, either not obſerving whence the word grew, or at leaſt, not ſufficiently expreſſing their knowledge, what it ſignified among them, from whom they took it. <hi>Feudum,</hi> whence the word (<hi>Fief,</hi> or Fee cometh, ſignifieth in the <hi>German</hi> language (<hi>beneficium cujus nomine ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra quaedam gratiae teſtificandae cauſa debentur, Hot. disput. cap.</hi> 1.) And by this name go all Lands and Tenements, that are held by any acknowledgement of any ſuperiority to a higher Lord. They that write of this ſubject, do divide all Lands and Tenements, wherein a man hath a perpetual eſtate to him and his Heirs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into <hi>Allodium &amp; Feudum. Allodium</hi> is defined to be every mans own land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he poſſeſſeth meerly in his own right, without acknowledgement of any ſervice, or payment of any rent unto any other, and this is a property in the higheſt degree, and of ſome it is called (<hi>Allaudium ab à privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va particula, &amp; laudum vel laudatio, ut ſit praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um cujus nullus author est nifi deus. Eſt enim laudare vel Novio teste, nominare. Quod &amp; Budaeus docuit ad Modeſtinum. 1. Herennius</hi> 63. <hi>π. de haere. institut. Prataeus, verbo Allaudium. Hotoman in verb. feud.</hi>) <hi>Feudum</hi> is that, which we hold by the benefit of another, and in the name whereof we owe ſervice, or pay rent, or both, to a ſuperior Lord. And all our land here in <hi>England</hi> (the Crown-land which is in the Kings own hands in the right of his Crown excepted) is in the nature of <hi>Feudum</hi> or Fee, for though many a man hath land by deſcent from the Anceſtors, and many another hath dearly bought land for his money, yet is the land of ſuch nature, that it cannot come to any, either by deſcent or purchaſe, but with the burthen that was laid upon him, who had novel Fee, or firſt of all received it as a benefit from his Lord, to him and to all ſuch, to whom it might deſcend, or any way be conveyed from him. So that if we will rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon with our Hoſt (as the proverb is) there is no man here, that hath <hi>directum dominium,</hi> i. the very property or <hi>demain</hi> in any Land, but the Prince in the right of his Crown. <hi>Cambd. Britan. pag.</hi> 93. for though he that hath Fee, hath <hi>jus perpetuum &amp; utile domixium:</hi> yet he oweth a duty for it: and therefore is it not ſimply his own. Which thing I take thoſe words, that we uſe for the expreſſing of our deepeſt rights in any Lands or Tenements, to import: for he that can ſay moſt for his eſtate, ſaith thus: I am ſeiſed of this or that land or tenement in my demain as of Fee. <hi>Seiſitus inde in dominico meo ut de feudo,</hi> and that is as much, as if he ſaid, it is my demain or proper land after a ſort: becauſe it is to me and mine Heirs for ever: yet not ſimply mine, becauſe I hold it in the nature of a benefit from another, yet the ſtatut <hi>an.</hi> 37 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 16. uſeth theſe words of lands inveſted in the Crown: but it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the ignorance of the nature of this word (<hi>Fee</hi> for ſee cannot be without fealty ſworn to a ſuperiour, as you may read part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the word <hi>(Fealtie)</hi> but more at large in thoſe that write <hi>de feudis:</hi> and namely <hi>Hoto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> both in his Commentaries and Diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And no man may grant, that our King or Crown oweth fealty to any ſuperior but God onely. Yet it may be ſaid, that land, &amp;c. with us is termed fee in two reſpects: one, as it belongeth to us and our Heirs for ever; and ſo may the Crown-lands be called Fee: the other as it holdeth of another, which is, and muſt be far from our Crown. <hi>Britton c.</hi> 32. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fineth fee to this effect. Fee is a right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the perſon of the true Heir, or of ſome other, that by juſt title hath purchaſed it. <hi>Fletz,</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Feudum est quod quis tenet ex quacun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que cauſa ſibi &amp; haeredibus ſuis, ſive ſit tenemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, ſive reditus qui non proveniunt ex camera, &amp; alio modo dicitur feudum, ſicut ejus qui feoff at, &amp; quod quis tenet ab alio ſicut dicitur: talis tenet de tali tot ſeuda per ſervitium militare, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>§.

The diviſions of fee in divers reſpects are many, and thoſe though little known to us in <hi>England,</hi> yet better wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be known, than we commonly think. But for our preſent purpoſe, it is ſufficient to divide Fee into two ſorts, Fee-abſolute other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called Fee-ſimple, and Fee-conditional, other-wiſe termed Fee-tail. Fee ſimple <hi>(Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ſimplex)</hi> is that whereof we are ſeiled in theſe general words, To us and our Heirs for ever. Fee-tail, <hi>Feudum taliatum,</hi> is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are ſeiſed to us and our Heirs with limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that is, the Heirs of our body, &amp;c. And Fee-tail is either general or ſpecial. General is, where land is given to a man and the Heirs of his body. The reaſon whereof is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Litleton, cap.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. becauſe a man ſeiſed of land by ſuch a gift, if he marry one or more wives, and have no iſſue by them, and at length marry another by whom he hath iſſue, this iſſue ſhall inherit the land. Fee-tail ſpecial is that, where a man and his wife be ſeiſed of lands to them and the Heirs of their two bodies. The reaſon is likewiſe given by <hi>Litleton</hi> in the ſame place, becauſe in this caſe, the Wife dying without iſſue, and he marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another, by whom he hath iſſue, this iſſue cannot inherit the land, being ſpecially given to ſuch heirs, &amp;c. This Fee-tail hath the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from the ſtatute of Weſtminſter 2. <hi>cap. pri.</hi> which was made <hi>anno</hi> 13 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1.

And this thing ſeeming unreaſonable to the wiſdome of our Realm, becauſe ſo a man meaning well to this or that poſterity of himſelf or his friends, might be forthwith deceived of his intention, the ſaid ſtatute was made for redreſſe of this inconvenience, whereby it is ordained, that if a man give lands in fee, limiting the Heirs to whom it ſhall deſcend, with a reverſion to himſelf or his Heirs for default, &amp;c. that the form and true meaning of his gift, ſhall be obſerved. Wherefore in what conſcience our Lawyers have invented means, ſo eaſily to cut off this form of gift, it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.

Weſemb. parat. titulo de tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act.</hi> For it appeareth by the Writers of the Common law, above named, that it is nothing but a compoſition or concord acknowledged &amp; recorded before a competent Judge, touching ſome hereditament or thing immoveable, that earſt was in controverſie between thoſe that be parties to the ſame concord: and that for the better credit of the tranſaction, being by imputation made in the preſence of the King, becauſe, it is levied in his Court: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth it bind Women covert being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and others whom ordinarily the Law diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth to tranſact, onely for this reaſon, that all preſumption of deceipt or evil meaning is excluded, where the King is privy to the Act. But diſcourſe of wit and reaſon, hath in time wrought other uſes of this concord, which in the beginning was but one: as namely, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the title that any man hath in his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt all men: to cut off Intails, and with more certainty to paſſe the Intereſt or the Title of any Land or Tenement, though not controverted, to whom we think good, either for years or in Fee. In ſo much that the paſſing of a Fine, in moſt caſes, now is it but <hi>mera fictio juris,</hi> alluding to the uſe for the which it was invented, and ſuppoſing a doubt or controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, where in truth none is: and ſo not onely to work a preſent preſcription againſt the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the concord, or fine, and their Heirs, but within five years againſt all others, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſly excepted (if it be levied upon good conſideration and without covine) as Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men covert, perſons under 21 years, or priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or ſuch as be out of the Realm at the time when it was acknowledged.

This fine is either ſimgle or double: A ſingle fine, is that by which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is granted or rendred back again by the Cognizees to the Cognizours, or any of them. A double fine containeth a grant &amp; render back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, either of ſome rent, comon, or other thing, out of the land or of the land it ſelf, to all, or ſome of the Cognizours, for ſome eſtate, limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby many times Remainders to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,

Again, a fine is of the effect, divided into a fine executed, and a fine executory. A fine executed is ſuch a fine, as of his own force giveth a preſent poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion (at the leaſt in law) unto the Cognizee, ſo that he needeth no writ of <hi>(Habere facias ſeiſinam)</hi> for the execution of the ſame, but may enter; of which ſort is a fine <hi>(ſur cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance de droit come ceo que il ad de ſon done)</hi> that is upon acknowledgement, that the thing men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the concord be <hi>jus ipſius cognizati, ut illa quae idem habet de dono Cognitoris. Weſt. Sect.</hi> 51. <hi>K.</hi> and the reaſon of this ſeemeth to be, becauſe this fine, paſſeth by way of releaſe of that thing, which the cognizee hath already (at the leaſt by ſuppoſition) by vertue of a former gift of the Cognizor, <hi>Cokes Reports, lib.</hi> 3. the caſe of ſines, <hi>fol.</hi> 89. <hi>b.</hi> which is, in very deed, the ſureſt fine of all. <hi>Fines executo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> be ſuch, as of their own force do not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the poſſeſſion in the Cognizees, as <hi>fines ſur cognizance de droit tantùm, fines ſur done,</hi> grant, releaſe, confirmation, or render. For if ſuch fines be not levied, or ſuch render made unto them, that be in poſſeſſion at the time of the fines levied, the cognizees muſt needs ſue Writs of <hi>(Habere facias ſeiſinam)</hi> according to their ſeveral caſes, for the obtaining of their poſſeſſions, except at the levying of ſuch execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory fines, the parties unto whom the eſtate is by them limited, be in poſſeſſion of the lan is paſſed thereby: for in this caſe ſuch fines do inure by way of extinguiſhment of right, nor altering the eſtate of poſſeſſion of the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zee, but perchance bettering it, <hi>Weſt. ubi ſupra, ſect.</hi> 20.</p>
                  <p>Touching the form of theſe Fines, it is to be conſidered upon what Writ or Action the concord is to be made, and that is, moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, upon a Writ of Covenant: and then firſt there muſt paſſe a payr of Indentures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Cognizour and Cognizee, whereby the Cognizour covenanteth with the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zee, to paſſe a Fine unto him, of ſuch or ſuch things by a day ſet down. And theſe Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as they are firſt in this proceeding, ſo are they ſaid to lead the Fine; upon this Covenant the Writ of Covenant is brought by the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizee againſt the Cognizour, who thereupon yeeldeth to paſſe the Fine before the Judge, and ſo the acknowledgement being recorded, the Cognizour and his Heirs are preſently concluded, and all ſtrangers not excepted, after five years once paſſed. If the Writ whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Fine is grounded, be not a Writ of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but of <hi>Warrantia chartae,</hi> or a Writ of right, or a Writ of <hi>meſn,</hi> or a Writ of Cuſtome and Services (for all theſe Fines may alſo be founded.

                     <hi>Foreſt (foreſta)</hi> is a French word ſignifying a great or vaſt wood. <hi>Lieu foreſtier et ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage: locus-ſylvestris et ſaltuoſus.</hi> The wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon the Common law define it thus: <hi>Foresta eſt locus ubi ferae inhabitant vel includun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Gloſſ. in ca. cum dilecti. extra. de donatio, et Felinus in cap.</hi> Rodulphus, <hi>verſu, quid an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem foresta. extra de reſcriptis,</hi> ſpeaketh to the ſame effect. Some other writers doe ſay it is called <hi>foresta, quaſi ferarum ſtatio, vel tuta manſio ferarum.</hi> But as it is taken with us, M. <hi>Manwood,</hi> in his ſecond part of Foreſt Lawes, <hi>ca.</hi> 1. <hi>nu.</hi> 1. thus defineth it: A fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt is a certain territory of woody grounds and fruitfull paſtures, privileged for wilde beaſts, and fouls of foreſt, chaſe, and warren, to reſt and abide in in the ſafe protection of the King, for his princely delight and pleaſure: which territory of ground ſo privlieged, is meered and bounded with unremoveable markes, meers, and boundaries, either known by matter of record, or elſe preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and alſo repleniſhed with wild beaſts of Venery, or chaſe, and with great coverts of vert, for the ſuccour of the ſaid wilde beaſts, to have their aboad in: for the preſervation and continuance of which ſaid place, together with the vert and veniſon, there are certain particular laws, privileges, and officers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſame, meet for that purpoſe, that are only proper unto a Foreſt, and not to any other place. The ſame definition he hath, <hi>parte</hi> 1. <hi>pa.</hi> 139. which though it have many ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities, yet it well expreſſeth the nature of the thing, eſpecially the explication adjoyned, which there is ſet down by the ſaid Author in both places, in his firſt part, <hi>pag.</hi> 16. where he fetcheth a foreſt from ſuch overgrown anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, alleging for it the 2 book of Kin. <hi>ca.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>&amp; ca.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. and the 104 Pſalm, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. the 131. verſ. 6. hee taketh licenſe to ſport himſelf; for though our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh tranſlation have the word Foreſt, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the vaſtneſſe of the deſart; yet if we look to the original idiome, wee ſhall find no more reaſon to call thoſe places foreſts, than either chaſes or parks.</p>
                  <p>The manner of making foreſts, as the ſame Author well ſetteth down, <hi>parte</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 142. is this: The King ſendeth out his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion under the broad Seal of England, directed to certain diſcreet perſons, for the view, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambulation, meering and bounding of the place that he mindeth to afforeſt. Which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the Chancery, proclamation is made throughout all the ſhire where the ground lieth, that none ſhall hunt or chaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny manner of wild beaſts within that precinct, without the Kings ſpeciall licenſe, after which he appointeth ordinances, lawes &amp; officers, fit for the preſervation of the vert &amp; veniſon: &amp; ſo becometh this a foreſt by matter of record. The properties of a foreſt are theſe in ſpeciall: firſt a foreſt as it is truly &amp; ſtrictly taken cannot be in the hands of any but the King: the reaſon is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by M. <hi>Manwood,</hi> becauſe none hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to grant commiſſion to be a juſtice in Eire for the foreſt, but the King, <hi>par.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 87. The ſecond property be the Courts, as the Juſtice ſent every three years, the Swainmoot thrice every year, <hi>Idem eod. pag.</hi> 90. <hi>et parte</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 1. <hi>nu.</hi> 4. <hi>et</hi> 5. and the attachment once every for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes, <hi>Idem eod. pag.</hi> 92. The third pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty may be the officers belonging unto it, for the preſervation of the vert and veniſon, as firſt the Juſtices of the foreſt, the Warden or Keeper, the Verders, the Foreſters, Agiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, Regarders, Bayliffs, Bedels, and ſuch like, which you may ſee in their places, See <hi>Manwood, parte</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 1. <hi>nu.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. But the chief property of a Foreſt, both by Maſter <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood parte</hi> 1. <hi>pa.</hi> 144. and Maſter <hi>Crompton, pa.</hi> 146. is the Swainemore? which, as they both agree, is no leſſe incident unto it, than the court of Pye owders to a Fair. Other Courts and Offices are not ſo requiſite, in thoſe foreſts that are in the hands of ſubjects, becauſe they be not truly foreſts. But if this fail, then is there nothing of a foreſt remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but it is turned into the nature of a Chace.

                     <hi>Homage (Homagium)</hi> is a French word, ſignifying <hi>Fidem clientularem.</hi>) For in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal grants of land and tenements by way of fee, the Lord did not only tye his tenents or feed men to certain ſervices, but alſo took a ſubmiſſion, with Promiſe and oath, to be true and loyal to him, as their Lord and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor. This ſubmiſſion was and is called homage: the form whereof you have in the ſecond Statute <hi>anno</hi> 17. <hi>Edw.</hi> 2 in theſe words: when a free man ſhall doe homage to his Lord, of whom he holdeth in chief, he ſhall hold his hands together between the hands of his Lord, and ſhall ſay thus; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your man from this day forth for life, for member, and for worldly honour, and ſhall owe you my faith for the land I hold of you: ſaving the faith, that I do owe unto our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord the King, and to mine other Lords. And in this manner the Lord of the fee, for which homage is due, taketh homage of every tenent, as he cometh to the land or fee. <hi>Glanvile lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. except they be women, who perform not homage but by their husbands, (yet ſee <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> that ſaith the contrary in his <hi>nat. br. fol.</hi> 157.

By our law a religious man may doe homage, but may not ſay to his Lord, <hi>Ego devenio home veſter,</hi> becauſe he hath profeſſed himſelf to be only Gods man, but he may ſay, I do unto you homage, and to you ſhall be faithfull and loyall.

Of which trial who may and who may not be empanelled, ſee <hi>Fitzh. nat, brev. fol.</hi> 165. <hi>D.</hi> And for better underſtanding of this point, it is to be known, that there be three manner of trials in <hi>England:</hi> one by Parliament, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Battel, and the third by Aſſize or Jury, <hi>Smith de Repub. Anglorum, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5, 6, 7. touching the two former read him, and ſee Battel and Combat, and Parliament: the trial by Aſſiſe (be the action civil or criminal, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like or private, perſonal or real) is referred for the fact to a Jury, and as they find it, ſo paſſeth the Judgement, and the great favour that by this the King ſheweth to his Subjects more than the Princes of other Nations, you may read in <hi>Glanvil, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. where he called it <hi>Regale beneficium clement is principis de conſilio procerum populis indultum, quo vitae hominum &amp; Status integritats tam ſalubriter conſulitur; ut in jure, quod quis in libero ſoli tenemento poſſidet, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinendo, duelli caſum declinare poſſint homines ambiguum, &amp;c.</hi> ſee the reſt. This Iury is not uſed only in Circuits of Juſtices Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but alſo in other Courts, and matters of Office, as if the Eſcheatour make inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any thing touching his Office, he doth it by Jury or Inqueſt; if the Coroner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how a ſubject found dead, came to his end, he uſeth an Inqueſt, the Juſtices of Peace in their Quarter Seſſions, the Sheriff in his County and Turn, the Bayliff of a Hundred, the Steward of a Court Leet, or Court Baron, if they inquire of any offence, or decide any cauſe between party and party, they doe it by the ſame manner. So that where it is ſaid that all things be triable by Parliament, Battel, or Aſſiſe; Aſſiſe in this place is taken for a Jury or Enqueſt, empanelled upon any cauſe in a Court where this kind of trial is uſed: and though it be commonly deemed, that this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of ending and deciding cauſes proceed from the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Britons,</hi> and was of favour permitted unto us by the Conquerour: yet I find by the grand <hi>Cuſtomarie</hi> of <hi>Normandy, cap.</hi> 24. that this courſe was uſed likewiſe in that Country. For Aſſiſe is, in that Chapter, defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be an aſſembly of wiſe men, with the Bayliff, in a place certain at a time aſſigned for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes before, whereby Juſtice may be done in cauſes heard in the Court. Of this cuſtom alſo, and thoſe Knights of <hi>Normandie, Johannes Faber</hi> maketh mention, in the <hi>Rubrique</hi> of the Title <hi>de militari testamento:</hi> in <hi>Inſtitut.</hi> this Jury, though it appertain to moſt Courts of the Common law, yet is it moſt notorious in the half-year Courts of the Juſtices errants, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the great Aſſiſes, and in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Seſſions, and in them it is moſt ordinarily called a Jury. And that in civil cauſes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in other Courts, it is oftener termed an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and in the Court Baron the Homage. In the general Aſſiſe, there are uſually many Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, becauſe there be ſtore of cauſes both civil and criminal comonly to be tried, whereof one is called the Grand Jury, and the reſt Petit Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: whereof it ſeemeth there ſhould be one for every Hundred, <hi>Lamb. Eirenar. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 384. The Grand Jury conſiſteth ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily of 24. grave and ſubſtantial Gentlemen, or ſome of them Yeomen, choſen indifferently out of the whole Shire by the Sheriff, to conſider of all Bils of Inditement preferred to the Court: which they doe either approve, by writing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them theſe words, <hi>Billa vera,</hi> or diſallow, by writing, <hi>Ignoramus:</hi> ſuch as they doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, if they touch Life and Death, are far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther referred to another Jury to be conſidered of, becauſe the caſe is of ſuch importance: but others of lighter moment, are upon their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, without more work, fined by the Bench, except the party travers the Inditement, or challenge it for inſufficiency, or remove the cauſe to a higher Court by <hi>Certiorari,</hi> in which two former caſes it is referred to another Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and in the latter tranſmitted to the higher, <hi>Lamb. Eir. li.</hi> 4. <hi>ca.</hi> 7. and preſently upon the allowance of this Bill by the Grand Enqueſt, a
<pb facs="tcp:56626:75"/>man is ſaid to be indited. Such as they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow, are delivered to the Bench, by whom they are forthwith cancelled or torn. The Petit Iury conſiſteth of twelve men at the leaſt, and are empaneled, as well upon cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal as upon civil cauſes; thoſe that paſſe upon offences of Life and Death, doe bring in their verdict either <hi>guiltie</hi> or not <hi>guilty;</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Priſoner, if he be found guilty, is ſaid to be convicted, and ſo afterward recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his judgement, and condemnation: or otherwiſe is acquitted and ſet Free. Of this read <hi>Forteſ. cap.</hi> 27. Thoſe that paſſe upon civil cauſes real, are all, or ſo many as can conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently be had, of the ſame Hundred, where the land or tenement in queſtion doth lie, and four at the leaſt. And they upon due exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination bring in their verdict either for the Demandant, or Tenent. Of this ſee <hi>Forteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue, cap.</hi> 25, 26. According unto which, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſſeth afterward in the Court where the cauſe firſt began: and the reaſon hereof is, becauſe theſe Juſtices of Aſſiſe, are in this caſe, for the eaſe of the Country, only to take the verdict of the Jury, by the vertue of the writ called <hi>(Niſi prius)</hi> and ſo return it to the Court where the cauſe is depending. See <hi>(Niſi prius)</hi> Joyn with this the chapter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly cited out of the Cuſtumary of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> and that of King <hi>Etheldreds</hi> laws, mentioned by Maſter <hi>Lamberd, verbo Centuria,</hi> in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Saxon words.

Now when the tribunal of the Kings Bench came to be ſetled at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the former courſe of Writ was kept for a long time, firſt ſending to the Sheriff of <hi>Middleſex</hi> to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the party, and if he could not be found there, then next to apprehend him whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. But this ſeeming too troubleſome for the Subject, it was at laſt deviſed, to put both theſe wits into one, and ſo originally to attach the party complained of upon a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall or fiction, that he was not within the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> but lurking elſewhere, and that therefore he was to be apprehended in any place elſe. where he was preſumed to lye hidden, by a Writ directed the Sheriff of the County where he is ſuſpected to be. And by this Writ a man being brought in, is committed to the Marſhall of that Court, in whoſe cuſtody when he is, then by reaſon he is in the ſame County where the Kings Bench is, he may be ſued upon an Action in that Court, whereas the original cauſe of apprehending him, muſt be a pretence of ſome deceit or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt committed, which moſt properly of old belonged to the cognizance of that Court.

Of this ſort is the word Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernable, which ſignifieth him that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſuch an Offence, as by law he may be thus bayled: for in many Caſes a man is not mainpernable: whereof ſee <hi>Brook titulo Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, per totum,</hi> and <hi>Fitzh. nat. brev. fol.</hi> 249. <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi> Maſter <hi>Manwood</hi> in his firſt part of his Foreſt laws, <hi>pa.</hi> 167. maketh a great difference between Bayl and Mainpriſe. For he that is mainpriſed (quoth he) is alwaies ſaid to be at large, and to go at his own liberty out of ward, after the day is ſet to mainpriſe, untill the day of his appearance, by reaſon of the ſaid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſummons, or otherwiſe. But otherwiſe it is where a man is let to bayl to four or two men, by the Lord Juſtice in Eyr of the Foreſt, untill a certain day. For there he is alwaies accounted by the Law to be in their ward and cuſtody for the time. And they may if they will, keep him in ward or in priſon all that time, or otherwiſe at their will So that he that is ſo bayled, ſhall not be ſaid by the Law to be at large, or at his own liberty.

Howbeit <hi>(Canonica portio)</hi> is properly uſed for that ſhare which every Canon or Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary receiveth yearly out of the common ſtock of the Church: and <hi>praebenda</hi> is a ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral benefice riſing from ſome temporal land, or church appropriated, toward the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a Clerk, or member of a collegiat Church; and is commonly ſurnamed of the place, whence the profit groweth. And Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends be either ſimple, or with dignity.

                     <hi>Praemunire,</hi> is taken either for a writ, or for the offence whereupon this writ is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The one may well enough be underſtood by the other. It is therefore to be noted, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> under pretence of her ſupremacy and the dignity of Saint <hi>Peters chair,</hi> grew to ſuch an incroaching, that there could not be a benefice (were it Biſhoprick, Abbathy, or other) of any worth here in <hi>England,</hi> the beſtowing whereof could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape the Pope by one means or other. In ſo much, as for the moſt part he granted out Mandates of Eccleſiaſtical livings, before they were void, to certain perſons by his Bulls, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rending therein a great care to ſee the Church provided of a Succeſſor before it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Whence it grew that theſe kinds of Bulls were called <hi>(Gratiae expectativae)</hi> or <hi>(Proviſiones)</hi> whereof you may read a learned diſcourſe in <hi>Duarenus,</hi> that worthy Civilian, in his tractate <hi>De beneficiis, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>ca.</hi> 1. and in his treatiſe <hi>De immunitate ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae Gallicanae.</hi> Theſe proviſions, were ſo rife with us, that at the laſt, King <hi>Edw.</hi> the third, that heroical Prince, not diſgeſting ſo intollerable an oppreſſion, made a ſtatute in the 25 year of his reign, <hi>stat.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. and another <hi>ſtat.</hi> 6. <hi>ejuſdem anni cap. p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet ſuch was the wantonneſs that grew out of his power, and the impatience of Princes in thoſe daies, that he ſtill adventured the continuance of theſe proviſions: in ſo much as King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond made likewiſe a ſtatute againſt them in the Twelfth year of his reign, <hi>ca.</hi> 15. and the 13 year <hi>ſtat.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. making mention of the ſaid firſt Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the ſame, and appointing the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe that offended againſt it, to be perpetual baniſhment, forfeiture of their lands, tenements, goods, and chattels, as by the ſame doth more at large appear.

                  <p>Some later ſtatutes do caſt this puniſhment upon other Offenders: as namely the ſtatute, <hi>anno</hi> 1 <hi>Eliz. cap. prim.</hi> upon him that deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Kings ſupremacy the ſecond time, &amp;c. and the ſtatute <hi>anno</hi> 13 <hi>Eliz cap.</hi> 2.

For that, where it is ſaid that any man for an offence committed ſhall incurre a premunire, it is meant, that he ſhall incurre the ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is inflicted againſt thoſe that tranſgreſs the ſtatute made, <hi>an.</hi> 16 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 5. which is commonly called the ſtatute of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire, which kind of reference is not unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in our ſtatutes. For example, I ſhew on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſtatute, <hi>anno</hi> 5 <hi>Elizabeth, cap.</hi> 5. where it is enacted, that if any man preach or teach by writing, that the common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the Realm do by that ſtatute forbid fleſh to be eaten, as of neceſſity for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of mans ſoul, that he ſhall for ſuch preaching, &amp;c. be puniſhed as they be, which be ſpreaders of falſe news: having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference thereby to thoſe ſtatutes which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the puniſhment of ſuch offenders.</p>
                  <p>Now touching the Etymologie of this word <hi>(Praemuuire)</hi> ſome think it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the ſtrength given to the Crown by the former ſtatutes, againſt the uſurpation of forain and unnateral power: which opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may receive ſome ground from the ſtatute, <hi>anno</hi> 25 <hi>Edward</hi> 3. <hi>stat.</hi> 6. <hi>cap. pri.</hi> But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think it to grow from the verb <hi>(Praemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere)</hi> being barbarouſly turned into <hi>(praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire)</hi> which corruption is taken from the rude Interpreters of the Civil and Canon-laws, who indeed do uſe the effect <hi>(Praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire)</hi> many times for the efficient cauſe <hi>(Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monere)</hi> according to the proverb: He that is well warned, is half armed.

For example, it is the Kings prerogative to grant protection unto his debtours againſt other creditours, untill himſelf be ſatisfied. <hi>Fitz. nat. br. fol.</hi> 28. <hi>B.</hi> to diſtrein for the whole rent upon one tenent, that hath not the whole land. <hi>Idem fol.</hi> 235. <hi>A.</hi> to require the Anceſtors debt of the heir, though not eſpecially bound. <hi>Brit. ca.</hi> 28. <hi>fol.</hi> 65. <hi>b.</hi> to ceaſe upon mony paid by his debtour into a Court, for the ſatisfaction of an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor. <hi>Plowden, fol.</hi> 322. <hi>a.</hi> to permit his debtours to ſiew for their debts by a <hi>(Quo minus)</hi> in the Exchequer. <hi>Perkins Graunts.</hi> 5. to be firſt paid by one that oweth mony both to him and others, <hi>Dyer, fol.</hi> 67. <hi>an.</hi> 20.

Only by the cuſtome of this Kingdom, he maketh no laws without the conſent of the three Eſtates, though he may quaſh any law concluded by them. And whether his power of making laws be reſtrained <hi>(de neceſſicate)</hi> or of a godly and commendable policy, not to be altered without great peril, I leave to the judgement of wiſer men.

And whereas ſome things are before reckoned both <hi>(inter regalia majora, et minora)</hi> the Reader muſt underſtand that this may be in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. For example, the power of raiſing a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, or of coyning mony, is <hi>inter majora:</hi> but the profit that groweth to the Prince by the one or other, is <hi>(inter minora)</hi> Now may there alſo be noted out of books a great number of prerogatives belonging to the King of this land, which do not bring profit to his coffers immediately, and therefore may be accounted <hi>inter regalia majora,</hi> or at the leaſt, in a middle or mixt nature, or <hi>inter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jora et minora,</hi> becauſe by a conſequent they tend to the increaſe of the Kings Exchequer.

                  <p>The receiving of an appeal from the loweſt Judge Eccleſiaſtical within his Province im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.

                     <hi>Preſcription (praeſcriptio)</hi> is a courſe or uſe of any thing for a time beyond the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of man, as the expoſition of the Law terms doth define it. <hi>Kitchin, fol.</hi> 104. ſaith thus: Preſcription is, when for continuance of time, whereof there groweth no memory, a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon hath particular right againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother particular perſon. And cuſtom is, where by continuance of time beyond memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, divers perſons have gotten a right: with whom agreeth <hi>Sir Edward Coke, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 32. <hi>a.</hi> And uſage is by continuance of time the efficient cauſe of them both, and the life of both preſcription and cuſtome. Thus ſaith <hi>Kitchin.</hi> But as in the Civil law, ſo I think likewiſe in the common, Preſcription may be in a ſhorter time. As for example, where the Statute, <hi>anno</hi> 1 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. ſaith, that all actions popular muſt be ſued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three years after the offence committed, and the Statute <hi>anno</hi> 7 <hi>ejuſdem, cap.</hi> 3. That four years being paſt after the offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in one caſe, and one year in another, no ſute can be commenced, and the Statute 31 <hi>Elizabeth, cap.</hi> 5. ſaith, (by way of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the two former Statutes) that all actions, &amp;c. brought upon any Statute, the penalty whereof belongeth to the King, ſhall be brought within two years after the offence committed, or elſe be void. And the ſtatute <hi>anno</hi> 39 <hi>Eliz. cap. prim. &amp; ſecund.</hi> ſaith, that actions brought after two years by any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon, or after three years by the King alone for decay of husbandry or tillage, ſhall be of no force. Whoſoever offendeth, againſt any ſuch ſtatute, and doth eſcape un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called for two years, or three years, in one caſe of the two later of theſe three ſtatutes, may juſtly be ſaid to have preſcribed an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity againſt that action. The like may be ſaid of the ſtatute made <hi>anno</hi> 23 <hi>Elizabeth. cap. primo,</hi> which ſaith, that all offences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in that ſtatute made in the 13 year of <hi>Elizab. cap.</hi> 2. are inquirable before both Juſtices of peace and of Aſſiſe, within one year and a day, after the offence committed: Alſo the title that a man obtaineth by the paſſing of five years after a fine acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of any land, or tenements, may juſtly be ſaid to be obtained by preſcription. And whereas the Statute <hi>anno</hi> 8 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 4. ſaith, that a Iudge or Clerk convicted for falſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring of plees, &amp;c. may be fined within two years; the two years being ended, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth againſt the puniſhment of the ſaid Statute; and whereas the Statute <hi>anno</hi> 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. ſaith, that he which will complain of maintenance or embracery, whereby perjury is committed by a lury, muſt do it within ſix daies, thoſe ſix daies ended the parties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe: and whereas the Statute <hi>anno</hi> 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. ſaith that a man being not indicted within 3 months of any offences there mentioned touching Service and Sacraments, he ſhall be clear from thence forward: the three months being ended, he preſcribeth: and the ſame may be ſaid of the Statute <hi>anno</hi> 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. which ſaith, that a man ſhall not be indited of any offence there mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed touching the decay of tillage, after three years.

And the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in this caſe is known by the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the goods, that the party deceaſed hath out of the Dioces, where he depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For if all his goods be in the ſame Dioces, then the Biſhop of the Dioces, or the Arch-deacon (according as their compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or preſcription is) hath the probat of the Teſtament: if the goods be diſperſed in divers Dioceſes, ſo that there be any ſum of note (as five pounds ordinarily) out of the Dioces where the party led his life: then is the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> the ordinary in this caſe by his prerogative. For whereas in old time, the will was to be proved in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Dioces, wherein the party deceaſed had any goods: it was thought convenient both to the ſubject, and to the Archiepiſcopal See, to make one proof for all before him, who was and is of all the general ordinary of his Province. But there may be antiently ſome compoſition between the Archbiſhop and an inferiour ordinary, whereby the ſum that maketh the prerogative is above five pound. See <hi>Praerogative of the Archbiſhop.</hi> This probat is made in two ſorts, either in common form, or <hi>perteſtes.</hi> The proof in common form, is only by the oath of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor, or party exhibiting the Will, who ſweareth upon his credulity, that the Will by him exhibited, is the laſt Will and Teſtament of the party deceaſed. The proof <hi>per teſtes</hi> is when over and beſide his oath, he alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth witneſſes, or maketh other proof, to confirm the ſame, and that in the preſence of ſuch as may pretend any intereſt in the goods of the deceaſed, or at the leaſt in their abſence, after they have been lawfully ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to ſee ſuch a Will proved, if they think good. And the later courſe is taken moſt commonly, where there is fear of ſtrife, and contention between the kindred or friends of the party deceaſed about his goods.

<pb facs="tcp:56626:106"/>That he ſaid unto them, That if they would not depart, he would ſue them as the Law would.

                     <hi>Recovery, (Recuperatio)</hi> comes of the French <hi>Reconvrer,</hi> i. <hi>Recuperare.</hi> It ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in our common law, an obtaining of any thing by Iudgement, or tryal of Law, as <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio</hi> doth among the Civilians. But you muſt underſtand, that there is a true recovery and a figned. A true recovery is an actual or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al recovery of any thing, or the value thereof by Iudgement: as if a man ſued for any land, or other thing moveable or immoveable, and have a verdict, and Iudgement for him. A feigned recovery is (as the Civilians call it) <hi>quaedam fictio juris,</hi> a certain form, or courſe ſet down by Law, to be obſerved for the better aſſuring of Lands or tenements un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. And for the better underſtanding of this, read <hi>Weſt. parte</hi> 2. <hi>ſymbol. titulo Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, ſect. pri.</hi> who ſaith, that the end, and effect of a recovery, is to diſcontinue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Eſtates tayls, Remainders, and Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and to bar the former owners thereof. And in this formality there be required three parties, <hi>viz.</hi> the Demandant, the Tenent, and the Vouchee. The Demandant is he that bringeth the Writ of Entry, and may be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Recoverer: The Tenent is he, againſt whom the writ is brought, and may be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Recoveree. The Vouchee is he, whom the Tenent voucheth, or calleth to warranty for the Land in demand. <hi>Weſt. ubi ſupra.</hi> In whom you may read more touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this matter.</p>
                  <p>But for example, to explain this point, a man that is deſirous to cut off an Eſtate tayl in lands or tenements, to the end, to ſell, give, or bequeath it, as himſelf ſeeth good, uſeth his friend to bring a writ upon him for this Land. He appearing to the writ ſaith for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that the Land in queſtion came to him, or his anceſtors, from ſuch a man or his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor, who in the conveyance thereof, bound himſelf and his heirs to make good the title unto him or them to whom it was conveyed. And ſo hers allowed by the court to call in this third man to ſay what he can for the juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his right to this land, before he ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed it. The third man commeth not: whereupon the land is recovered by him that brought the writ: and the Tenent of the land is left for his remedy to the third man that was called and came not in to defend the Tenent. And by this means the entayl which was made by the Tenent, or his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor, is cut off by judgement hereupon given: for that he is pretended to have no power to entayl that land, whereunto be had no juſt title, as now it appeared: becauſe it is evicted, or recovered from him.</p>
                  <p>This kind of recovery is by good opinion, but a ſnare to deceive the people. <hi>Doctor and Stud. cap.</hi> 32. <hi>diai. pri. fol.</hi> 56. <hi>a.</hi> This feigned recovery is alſo called a common recovery: And the reaſon of that <hi>Epitheton</hi> is, becauſe it is a beaten and common path to that end, for which it is ordained, <hi>viz.</hi> to cut off the eſtates above ſpecified. See the new book of Entries, <hi>verbo, Recovery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſaid before, that a true recovery is as well of the value, as of the thing: for the better underſtanding whereof, know, that (in value) ſignifies as much as <hi>(Illud quod intereſt)</hi> with the Civilians. For example, if a man buy land of another with warranty, which land a third perſon afterward by ſute of Law recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth againſt me, I have my remedy againſt him that ſold it me, to recover in value, that is, to recover ſo much in mony as the land is worth, or ſo much other land by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change. <hi>Fitzh. nat. brev. fol.</hi> 134. <hi>K.</hi> To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a warranty, <hi>Old nat. brev. fol.</hi> 146. is to prove by judgement that a man was his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant againſt all men, for ſuch a thing.</p>

As if the Inhabitants of a Town-ſhip do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble to pull down a hedge, or pale, to have their common, where they ought to have none, or to beat a man that hath done them ſome publike offence or diſpleaſure.

                     <hi>Soccage (ſoccagium)</hi> commeth of the French (<hi>Soc,</hi> i. <hi>vomer,</hi> a Plowſhare or coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.) It ſignifieth in our Common law a tenure of Lands by or for certain inferior or hubandry ſervices to be performed to the Lord of the Fee. See <hi>Institutes of Common law,</hi> 31. As I have ſhewed in <hi>(Chivalry)</hi> all ſervices due for land, is either Knights-ſervice, or ſoccage. So then, whatſoever is not Knights ſervice, is ſoccage: <hi>Bracton</hi> in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond book, <hi>ca.</hi> 35. <hi>nu pri,</hi> deſcribeth it thus. <hi>Dici poterit ſoccagium a Soeco, &amp; inde tenen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes qui tenent in Sockagio, Sockmanni dici po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terunt, eo quod deputati ſunt, ut videtur, tamtummodo ad culturam, et quorum cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, &amp; maritagia ad propinquiores paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes jure ſanguinis pertinebit.

Quia non ſemper ſequitur homagium, licet aliquande ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatur. M. Skene deverb. ſignif. verb. Socman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> ſaith, that Soccage is a kind of holding of Lands when a man is infeoffed freely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſervice, ward, relief, or Mariage and payeth to his Lord ſuch duty, as is called petit ſergeantie, or when one holdeth land in the name of burgage, or in <hi>libera elemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zina,</hi> or otherwiſe in <hi>blenſhe ferme, five no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine alba firmae, &amp; opponitur militi, qui tenet per ſervitium militare.</hi> Out of the place above named in <hi>Bracton,</hi> you may find a diviſion of Soccage, whereby it is termed either <hi>Soccagium liberum,</hi> or <hi>villanum,</hi> frank or free Soccage, and baſe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called villenage, The former is there
<pb facs="tcp:56626:122"/>thus defined. <hi>Soccagium liberum est, ubi fit ſervitium in denariis Dominis capitalibus et nihil inde omnino datur ad ſcutum et ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium Regis.</hi> Where I gather that to be free ſoccage which payeth a certain ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the chief Lord in regard of ſome til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, or ſuch like, and not of any Sergean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or eſchuage.

The <hi>oldna. br. fol.</hi> 94. maketh three parts of this diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>viz.</hi> Socage of free tenure, Soccage of antient tenure, and Soccage of baſe tenure. Soccage of free tenure is (as the book ſaith) where a man holdeth by free ſervice of 12. pence by year, for all manner of ſervices, or by other ſervices yeerly. Soccage of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient tenure is of land of antient <hi>Demeſn,</hi> where no writ originall ſhall be ſued, but the Writ of Right, that is called <hi>ſecundum conſuetudinem manerii.</hi> Soccage of baſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure is of thoſe that hold in Socage, and may have none other writ, but the <hi>Monſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verunt:</hi> and ſuch Sock-men hold not by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Service. And for that are they not free Sockmen. Then again Soccage is divided into ſoccage in chief, and common ſoccage. Socage in chief or in <hi>capite,</hi> is that which holdeth of the king, as of his Crown. <hi>Frae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rog. fol.</hi> 41. Common Soccage is that, which holdeth of any other capitall Lord, or of the King by reaſon of ſome honour or manner. <hi>Ibidem</hi> Burgage is alſo a kind of Socage, ſee <hi>Burgage.</hi>

                  <p>I have read in an antient Manuſcript of what credit I know not, that this Officer was of ſo great power in antient times, that if any one had ſought juſtice in the Kings Court and not found it, he might upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint therof made unto him, take thoſe Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and reſerving them to the next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cauſe them there to be propounded, and not only ſo, but alſo in the preſence of the King openly to rebuke the Chancellor or any other Judge or officer whom he found defective in yeilding Juſtice.

For example, the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> payeth yeerly ten pounds, for ſuch things as are by their Charter granted them in ſee ferm, five pounds at the Annunciation, and five at Michaelmas. Hee that payeth the firſt five pounds, receiveth for his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge a tail or talley, and he that payeth the other five receiveth the like. With both which, or notes of them, he repaireth to the Clerk of the Pipes office, and there, in ſtead of them, receiveth an acquittance in parchment for his whole diſcharge.

                     <hi>Taske, aliâs Taxe,</hi> by <hi>M. Camden</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the authority of <hi>Doctor Powell</hi> (whom he greatly commendeth for his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the ſearch of Antiquities) is a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh word ſignifying tribute. <hi>Camden Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. pag.</hi> 304. And it ſeemeth, it is ſuch a kind of tribute, as being certainly rated upon every Town, was wont to be yearly paid. See <hi>Gild,</hi> and the places there cited out of <hi>Maſter Cambden.</hi> Now it is not paid, but by conſent given in Parliament, as the Subſidie is. And it differeth from Subſidy in this, that it is alway certain, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as it is ſet down in the Chequer book, and levyed in general of every Town, and not particularly of every man. Laſtly, it is a fifteenth of that ſubſtance, that every Town was firſt rated at by the number of Hides of Land in the ſame. Whereupon it is alſo called a fiſteenth, <hi>vide anno</hi> 14 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>ſtatut.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 20.

See <hi>Fifteenth.</hi> It ſeemeth that in antient times, this task was impoſed by the King at his pleaſure, but <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, <hi>anno</hi> 25. of his reign, bound himſelf, and his ſucceſiors from that time forward, not to levy it, but by the conſent of the Realm, <hi>anno</hi> 25 <hi>Ed. pri. cap.</hi> 5.

But to have preſcription of toll traverſe, is good. In which place the difference between the one, and the other, the new expoſitour of Law Terms ſaith to be, that toll traverſe is that money, which is taken for paſſing over a private mans ground. But this Author ſeemeth to differ from <hi>Kitchin</hi> touching the lawfulneſſe of toll through, ſaying, that by reaſon of a Bridge provided at the coſt and charge of the town, for the eaſe of Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, he thinketh it reaſonable, that toll through be enacted toward the maintenance thereof: which VVriter alſo maketh mention of toll Turn: and that he defineth to be toll paid for beaſts driven to be ſold, though they be not ſold indeed.

                     </gap>ony, or may be gathered out of <hi>Stawnf. pl. cor. fol.</hi> 38. where he ſaith, that for a Lord of the Parliament to depart from the Parliament without the Kings licenſe, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther treaſon nor felony, but treſpals. And again, <hi>fol.</hi> 31. ſaying that where it was wont before the Statute made, <hi>anno prim. Edw.</hi> a called <hi>Statutum de frangentibus priſonam,</hi> that the breach of Priſon was felony, if it were the Kings priſon: it is ſithence but treſpaſſe, except the Priſoner were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for felony. But it is moſt commonly uſed for that wrong or dammage, which is doue by a private man to the King, as in his Foreſt, <hi>pl. cor. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. or to another private man. And in this ſignification it is of two ſorts: treſpaſſe general, otherwiſe termed, treſpaſſe <hi>vi et armis;</hi> and treſpaſs eſpecial, otherwiſe called treſpaſſe upon the caſe. And this ſeemeth to be without force. Terms of the Law. Action upon the caſe, as appeareth by <hi>Kitchin, fol.</hi> 176. The former I take to be called general, becauſe it riſeth from that general ground in Law, and whatſoever is done by any private mans humour, <hi>vi et armis,</hi> is an offence. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I call eſpecial, becauſe <hi>Kitchin</hi> calleth the other general: and another reaſon may be this, becauſe it ſpringeth from a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſe or fact, not contained under any other general head. And the action lying for this treſpaſſe, is otherwiſe called an action upon the caſe, as may be gathered out of divers places under the title <hi>Treſpaſſe,</hi> in <hi>Brook</hi> his Abridgement. How to diſtinguiſh the form of theſe writs or actions, ſee <hi>Fitzherb. nat. br. fol.</hi> 86. <hi>L.</hi> &amp; 87. <hi>H. I.</hi> in an Action of treſpaſſe, this is perpetual, that the Plaintiff ſueth for dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, or the value of the burt done unto him by the Defendant. It ſeemeth an hard thing to diſtinguiſh theſe two kinds of treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes ſo, as to be able to ſay when it is a treſpaſſe <hi>vi et armis,</hi> and when upon the caſe: as may well appear to him that ſhall peruſe this title in <hi>Brook.</hi> But this is to be left to the experience of grave and skilfull Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. I find moreover in <hi>Kitchin, ſo.</hi> 188. that there is a <hi>treſpaſſe local,</hi> and <hi>treſpaſſe tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory: trespaſs local</hi> is that, which is ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to a place certain, as if the Defendant joyn iſſue upon the place, and traverſe the place, only by ſaying, <hi>Abſque hoc,</hi> that he did the treſpaſſe in the place mentioned in the declaration, and aver it, it is enough to defeat the action. <hi>Treſpaſs tranſitory</hi> is that, which cannot be defeated by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants traverſe of the place, ſaying. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that I committed the treſpaſſe in the place declared: becauſe the place is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial. Examples of both you have ſet down by <hi>Kitchin,</hi> in the place above named, to this effect: traverſe by <hi>(Abſque boc)</hi> of treſpaſs in battery, or goods brought in, is tranſitory and not local: as it is of trees cut, and he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And therefore in treſpaſſe tranſitory, the place ſhall not make iſſue, neither is it tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſable: no more than is a treſpaſſe upon a caſe of an Aſſumption. <hi>Bracton</hi> in his fourth book, <hi>cap.</hi> 34. <hi>num.</hi> 6. divideth <hi>tranſgreſſionem in majorem et minorem:</hi> which place read.

                     <hi>Tryal. (triatio)</hi> is uſed in our Common law, for the examination of all cauſes civil
<pb facs="tcp:56626:132"/>or criminal, according to the laws of our Realm.

And be it farther enacted by the anthority aforeſaid, that all tryals hereafter to be had, awarded or made for any Treaſon, ſhall be had and uſed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the due order and courſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon laws of this Realm, and not otherwiſe, &amp;c. By this word <hi>(tryal)</hi> ſaith <hi>Stawnf.</hi> in that place, ſome underſtand as well the inqueſt that indicteth a man, as the inqueſt upon the arraignment, that attainteth or acquiteth him. For theſe two make but one entire tryal, that every man is to have, when he is impeached of treaſon. But others have anſwered to this, that tryal in common ſpeech, is the tryal that a man is to have, after he is indicted, and not before. For in Law the Inditement is nought, but the accuſation againſt him, which he is to make anſwer unto, and that being try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it either attainteth, or acquitteth him. So that the tryal is the lſſue, which is tryed upon the Inditement, and not the Inditement it ſelf. For that is no part of the thing which tryeth, but the thing which is tryed, and the offence. And ſo this word Tryal underſtood in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <hi>an.</hi> 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 23. where he ſaith thus; Muſt be indicted within the Shires or places where they committed their offences, and alſo tryed before by the Inhabitants, or Free-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.

In this Court (as <hi>Briton</hi> ſaith <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi ſupra</hi>) the Sheriff cauſeth to be found out twelve of the moſt ſage, loyal and ſufficient men of all the Hundred (for he kept his turn twice every year in each Hundred. <hi>Magna Charta, cap.</hi> 35. <hi>&amp; Briton ubi ſupra.</hi>) whom he charged upon their Oaths to preſent the truth touching the articles miniſtred unto them, and ſet down by <hi>Briton</hi> in the ſame Chapter.

                     <hi>Twelve men (Duodecim homines legales)</hi> is a number of 12 perſons, or upwards to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 24. by whoſe diſcretion all tryals paſs both in civil and criminal cauſes, through all Courts of the common Law in this Realm. Firſt for civil cauſes, when proof is made of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in queſtion, as the parties and their Counſel think good on both ſides, the point of the fact, that they are to give their verdict of, is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red likewiſe unto them, which we call the iſſue: and then are they put in mind of their oath formerly taken, to do right between party and party, and ſo ſent out of the Court ſeverally by themſelves to conſider upon the evidence of both ſides, untill they be agreed; which done, they return to the Court again, and deliver their verdict by the mouth of the foreman. And according to the verdict, Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment afterward paſſeth, either condemnatory for the Plaintiff, or abſolutory for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant. Theſe twelve be called twelve <hi>milites. Glanvile, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 14, <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. and ſo be they in <hi>Bracton</hi> divers times: but that word is altered.</p>
                  <p>In cauſes criminal there be two ſorts of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, one called the grand Enqueſt, and the other the Enqueſt of life and death. The grand Enqueſt is ſo called, either becauſe it conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth commonly of a greater number than twelve, as of twenty four, eighteen, or ſixteen at the leaſt; or elſe becauſe all cauſes criminal or penal firſt paſſe through them: whereas the other Enqueſt is eſpecially appointed for one or few matters touching life and death, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their conſideration. Thoſe of the grand Enqueſt are alſo called by <hi>Bracton</hi> 12 <hi>milites, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>tract.</hi> 2. <hi>cap. pri. num.</hi> 2. becauſe they were wont to be Knights, as it ſeemeth, and not inferiours, except ſo many Knights could not be found, <hi>Idem, eodem, num.</hi> 1. <hi>in fine.</hi> And their function is to receive all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments made unto them of any offence, and accordingly to give their general opinion of the preſentment by writing either theſe words <hi>(Billa vera)</hi> upon the bill of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, which is an inditement of the party preſented: or elſe this word <hi>(Ignoramus)</hi> which is an abſolving of him. Now as crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſes be of two ſorts, either capital touching life and member, or finable: ſo is there a double courſe of theſe Indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For in cauſes only finable, the party indited muſt either traverſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement by denying it, and ſo it is referred to a petit Jury, whereby he is either convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or diſcharged of the crime, or elſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing it, the Court ſetteth his fine upon his head without more work. But in matters of life and death, the party indited is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to hold up his hand, and anſwer (guilty) or (not guilty) if (guilty) he ſtandeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed by his own confeſſion: if (not guilty) he is farther referred to the Enqueſt of life and death, which conſider upon the proof brought againſt the Priſoner, and accordingly bring in their verdict (Guilty) or (not Guilty) ſo is he judged to dye, or delivered by the Court.

Manwood, parte pri.</hi> of his Foreſt laws, <hi>pag.</hi> 332. defineth him) a Iudicial Officer of the Kings foreſt, choſen by the King, in the full County of the ſame Shire, within the Foreſt, where he doth dwell, and is ſworn to maintain, and keep the Aſſiſes of the Foreſt, and alſo to view, receive, and and inroll the Attachments and preſentments of all manner of Treſpaſſes of the Foreſt, of vert and veniſon. And the ſame Author upon the firſt article of <hi>Canutus</hi> Charter, in the beginning of the ſame part, ſaith, that theſe in the Saxons times were called <hi>(Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gened)</hi> being four in number, and they chief men of the Foreſt, as then they were. Their Fee was in <hi>Canutus</hi> time, each of them every year of the Kings allowance, two horſes, one of them with a ſaddle, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them without a ſaddle, one Sword, fiue Iavelings, one Spear, one Shield, and ten pounds in mony. Theſe four (as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the ſaid Charter, <hi>num.</hi> 11.) had <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galem poteſtatem,</hi> and might proceed to a three-fold judgement: And if any man offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, or any of them violence, if he were a free man, he ſhould loſe his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and all that he had: if a villein, he ſhould loſe his right hand. And all the Officers of the Foreſt were to be corrected and puniſhed by them; <hi>Ibidem, num.</hi> 10. The Verdour is made by the Kings writ, <hi>Cromptons juriſd. fol.</hi> 165. the form of which writ you have in <hi>Fitzh. nat. brev. fol.</hi> 164. which is directed to the Sheriff for the choiſe of him in a full County, by the aſſent of the ſaid County. Yet if a Verdour be ſuddenly ſick or dead, at the time of the Iuſtice ſeat, a new may be choſen without a writ, <hi>Manwood parte prim. pag.</hi> 72. the office is (as <hi>Cromp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> ſaith <hi>loco allegato</hi>) properly to look to the vert, and to ſee that it be well maintained. Alſo when any forfeiture is taken in the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt before the Foreſters or other Miniſters, the price thereof ſhall be delivered to the Verdour, who is to anſwer for it before the Iuſtices in <hi>Eyr.</hi> And if he die, his heir is chargeable therewith. <hi>Crompton ibidem.</hi> The form of his oath at his admittance you may ſee in <hi>Manwoods</hi> firſt part of his Foreſt laws, <hi>pag.</hi> 51. who there calleth him <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derour, aliàs verdictor.</hi> You ſhall truly ſerve our Soveraign Lord the King, in the office of a <hi>verderor</hi> of the Foreſt W. you ſhall to the uttermoſt of your power, and knowledge, do for the profit of the King, ſo far as it doth appertain unto you to do. You ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and maintain the antient rights and franchiſes of his Crown: you ſhall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal from his Majeſty any rights or privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, nor any offence either in vert or veniſon, or any other thing. You ſhall not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, nor abridge any defaults, but ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour your ſelf to manifeſt and redreſſe the ſame, and if you cannot do that of your ſelf, you ſhall give knowledge thereof unto
<pb facs="tcp:56626:135"/>the King, or unto his Iuſtice of the Foreſt. You ſhall deal indifferently with all the Kings liege people: you ſhall execute the laws of the Foreſt, and do equal right and juſtice, as well unto the poor, as unto the rich in that appertaineth unto your office: you ſhall not oppreſs any perſon by colour thereof, for any reward, favour, or malice. All theſe things you ſhall to the uttermoſt of your power obſerve and keep. Their Office is farther expreſſed, <hi>eodem, pag.</hi> 93. which is to ſit in the Court of Attachment, to ſee the Attachments of the Foreſt, to receive the ſame of the Foreſters and Woodwards, that do preſent them, and then to enter theſe at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tachments into their Roles.</p>

                     <hi>Verdict (veredictum)</hi> is the anſwer of a Jury or Enqueſt made upon any cauſe civil or criminal, committed by the Court to their conſideration or tryal. And this verdict is two-fold: either general or eſpecial, <hi>Stawnf. pl. cor. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. A general verdict is that which is given or brought into the Court, in like general terms to the general iſſue: as in an action of <hi>diſſeiſin</hi> the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant pleadeth, <hi>No wrong, no diſſeiſin.</hi> Then the iſſue is this in general, whether the fact in queſtion be a wrong or not. And this committed to the Iury, they upon conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their evidence, come in and ſay, either for the Plaintiff, that it is wrong, and diſſeiſin; or for the Defendant, that it is no wrong, no diſſeiſin. And again, the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at the bar pleading, Not guilty: the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt in like general terms bring in their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, either for the King, Guilty; or for the priſoner, Not guilty. A ſpecial verdict is that, whereby they ſay at large, that ſuch a thing, and ſuch, they find to be done by the Defendant, or Tenent, ſo declaring the courſe of the fact, as in their opinion it is proved: and for the quality of the fact, they pray the diſcretion of the Court. And this ſpecial verdict, if it contain any ample decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the cauſe, from the beginning to the end, is alſo called a verdict at large. Whereof read divers examples in <hi>Stawnf. pl. cor. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. and one or two in <hi>Littleton, fol.</hi> 78. <hi>&amp;</hi> 79. See the new book of Entries, <hi>verb.

<pb facs="tcp:56626:136"/>this effect: Villenage is a tenure of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſns of a Lord delivered to a Tenent at the Lords will, by villenous ſervices, to improve it to the Lords uſe, and delivered by the Rod, and not by any Title of Writing, or ſucceſſion of Inheritance, &amp;c. And a little after he hath words to this effect: In the Manors of our Antient Demeſns, there be pure villeins both by blood and tenure: the which may be caſt out of their tenement, and deprived of their chatels, at the pleaſure of the Lord. By which two places I gather, though villein tennre do not alway make the Tenent a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lein: yet that there is a two fold tenure called villenage: one wherein both the perſon and the tenure is bound, and in all reſpects at the diſpoſicion of the Lord: and another which in reſpect of the tenure, is after a ſort ſervile, though the perſon be not bond.

<pb facs="tcp:56626:138"/>and is commonly ſaid to be all that, which precedeth the <hi>(Habendum)</hi> or limitation of the eſtate, which be the perſons contracting, and the things contracted. The conſequent is that which followeth the premiſes, and that is the <hi>(Habendum.)</hi> In which are two limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: the one of the eſtate, or property, that the party paſſive ſhall receive by the deed; the other of the uſe, which is to expreſs in the ſaid <hi>(Habendum)</hi> to or for what uſe, and benefit he ſhall have the ſame eſtate. And of the limitation of thoſe uſes, you may read many preſidents ſet down by the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in his ſecond book of his ſaid firſt part, <hi>ſect.</hi> 308. and ſo forth to 327.

<pb facs="tcp:56626:140"/>eth himſelf to warrant the land or tenement to the tenent. And Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> in the fourth book of his Reports, mentioneth the ſame diſtinction, <hi>Nokes caſe, fol.</hi> 81. <hi>a.</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the one a warranty in law, the other an expreſſe warranty.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Warranty</hi> (as the ſaid Author of the terms of law ſaith) is in 2 manners: warranty lineal, &amp; warranty collateral. But (<hi>Litleton</hi> ſaith <hi>ubi ſupra</hi>) it is threefold: warranty lineal, warranty collateral, and warranty that beginneth by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſin. Warranty by diſſeiſin what it is, is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared in Sir <hi>Edw. Cooks</hi> Reports, <hi>li.</hi> 3. <hi>Fermors caſe, fol.</hi> 78. <hi>a.</hi> VVhether of them divideth more aptly, let the learned Judge. For my part, I think that lineal and collateral be no eſſential differences, of warranty, as it is originally conſidered in the firſt warranter. For he bindeth himſelf and his heirs in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. And ſuch be bound, be they lineal or collateral unto him. Therefore this diviſion riſeth rather from the event of the original warranty: <hi>videlicet,</hi> becauſe it ſo falleth out, that the tenent, to whom the warranty was made, or his heirs, when he or they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into queſtion for the land warranted for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly by the firſt feoffour, is driven by the means of the firſt warranters death, to call or vouch him to warranty that is his heir, and now preſently living, be he deſcending or collateral, as it falleth out. For example, <hi>A. enfeoff. th B.</hi> in twenty acres of land, with clauſe of warranty againſt all men. So long as <hi>A.</hi> himſelf liveth he is lyable to this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and none elſe: after his deceaſe his heir is ſubject unto it, be he his Son, Brother, Uncle, or what elſe. And whether of theſe, or neither of theſe it will be, none knoweth untill he be dead. Wherefore I conclude, that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinction of lineal or collateral hath no uſe originally in this contract. For (as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the terms of Law ſaith) the burthen of this warranty, after the death of the firſt warranter, falleth upon him, upon whom the land ſhould have deſcended, if the warranty had not been made. And that is the next of blood to the warranter, be he in the deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or collateral line. And therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve that this diſtinction groweth from an event, after the death of him that covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to warrant. But to make this plain, I find warranty to be uſed equivocally: ſignifying one ſort, the contract, or covenant of warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty firſt made, as appeareth by <hi>Bracton</hi> in the place formerly noted: and in another ſort, the very effect and performance of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, either by the Warrenter or his heirs, when he or they be by the tenent thereunto vouched, or called. As alſo I ſhew out of <hi>Bracton, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>tract:</hi> 4. <hi>cap. pri. nu.</hi> 2. in theſe words: <hi>Inprimis videndum est quid ſit war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantizatio.

So if he commit felony after ſuch war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty covenanted, and forfeited his lands to his Lord by eſcheat, the Lord is <hi>queſihares</hi> in this caſe, and lyable to the warranty ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly paſſed. And in theſe two later caſes, warranty in the ſecond ſignification ſeemeth to be neither lineal, nor collateral: and at the leaſt, as <hi>Littleton,</hi> and the other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb facs="tcp:56626:140"/>have defined, or by example expreſſed them.</p>
                  <p>But let us define theſe two ſpecies as they be; wherefore lineal warranty is that, which he is called unto by the Tenent, upon whom the land warranted had deſcended, if the warrantee had not been covenanted. For example: <hi>A.</hi> ſelleth to <hi>B.</hi> twenty acres land with clauſe of warranty, and afterward dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth leaving iſſue <hi>C.</hi> ſoon after <hi>B.</hi> is implead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for this Land by <hi>D.</hi> and voucheth <hi>C.</hi> This is called a lineal warranty: becauſe but for it the land had deſcended from <hi>A.</hi> to <hi>C.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Warranty collateral</hi> is that, whereunto he is called by the Tenent, upon the covenant of him, from whom the Land could not deſcend, to the party called. For example: <hi>B.</hi> the Son purchaſeth Tenements in fee, whereof <hi>A.</hi> his Father diſſeiſeth him, and ſelleth them to <hi>C.</hi> with a clauſe of warranty. <hi>A.</hi> being dead, <hi>C.</hi> is impleaded for the Tenements, and calleth <hi>B.</hi> to warranty. This warranty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <hi>B.</hi> is called, ia collateral: becauſe the Tenements, if the warranty had not been co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted by <hi>A.</hi> could not have deſcended from him to his Father <hi>A.</hi> for they were his own by purchaſe. Many other examples there be of this in <hi>Littleton.</hi> And this very caſe he maketh his example of warranty by diſſeiſin, as alſo of warranty collateral, which plainly argueth, that warranty by diſſeiſin, and warranty collateral, are not diſtinct mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of warrantee, but may be confounded: though one warranty may carry both names in divers reſpects. For there is ſome war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty collateral that beginneth not by diſſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin. For example: <hi>A.</hi> Tenent in tayl, ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated to <hi>B.</hi> in fee, and dyeth leaving iſſue, <hi>C.</hi> afterward. <hi>D.</hi> Brother to <hi>A.</hi> and Uncle to <hi>C.</hi> releaſeth to <hi>B.</hi> with warranty, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, leaveth <hi>B.</hi> his heir being next of blood unto him. This warraaty is collateral, becauſe it deſcendeth upon <hi>C.</hi> from his Vncle <hi>D.</hi> and yet it beginneth not by diſſeiſin of his ſaid Uncle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Warranty</hi> hath a double effect: one to debar him upon whom it deſcendeth from the firſt warranter as his next of blood, from claiming the land warranted: and another to make it good to the Tenent, if by him he be vouched thereunto, or elſe to give him as much other land by exchange. But as the former of theſe effects taketh place with all heirs, except thoſe to whom the Land war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted was entailed, and that reap no equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent benefit by the firſt warranter, <hi>anno</hi> 6 <hi>Ed. prim. cap.</hi> 3. ſo the later prejudiceth none that receiveth not ſufficient Land from the firſt warranter to make it good, <hi>Bracton, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>tractat.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>num. prim. &amp; cap.</hi> 13. <hi>num.</hi> 2.

A warren (as we uſe it) is a preſcription or grant from the King to a man, of having Feaſants, Partridges, Connies, and Hares, within certain of his Lands, <hi>Cromp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons Juriſd. fol.</hi> 148. where he ſaith, that none can have warren but only the King, no more than Foreſt, or Chaſe. Becauſe it is a ſpecial privilege belonging to the King alone. And a little after he hath theſe words to this effect: the King may grant warren to me in
<pb facs="tcp:56626:141"/>mine own lands, for Feaſants and Patridges only. And by this grant no man may there chaſe them without my licence. And ſo of Hares, but not of Connies. For their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to deſtroy the fruits of the earth, as to eat Corn, and pill the bark of Apple trees. Maſter <hi>Manwood</hi> in his firſt part of Foreſt laws, ſaith thus of it: a warren is a franchiſe, or privileged place of pleaſure, only for thoſe beaſts and fowles that are beaſts and fowles of warren, <hi>tantùm campeſtres, &amp; non ſylvestres, viz.</hi> For ſuch beaſts &amp; fowls as are altogether belonging to the fields, and not unto the woods: and for none other beaſts or fowles. There are but two beaſts of warren, that is to ſay, Hares and Connies: And there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo but two fowles of warren, <hi>viz.</hi> Feaſants and Partridges. And none other wildbeaſts or birds have any firm peace, privilege, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, within the warren. If any perſon be found to be an offendor in any ſuch free warren, he is to be puniſhed for the ſame by the courſe of the Common law, and by the Statute, <hi>anno</hi> 21 <hi>Edward.</hi> 3. called the Statute <hi>de malefactoribus in parcis &amp; chaceis, &amp;c.</hi> For the moſt part there are no Officers in a warren, but the Maſter of the Game, or the Keeper. A free warren is ſometime incloſed; and alſo the ſame ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time doth lye open, for there is no neceſſity of incloſing the ſame, as there is of a Park, for if a Park is ſuffered to lye open, it ought to be ſeiſed into the Kings Kings hands.

By this all other things are weighed that paſs between man and man by weight, ſaving only thoſe above named. Why the one ſhould be called Troy weight, I have not learned, though I read it termed <hi>libram &amp; unciam Trojanam:</hi> as if it came from Troy. But <hi>Georg.

                     <hi>Writ (breve)</hi> is that with our Common Lawyers (in Sir <hi>Thomas Smiths</hi> judgement, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Repub.

And theſe writs are diverſly divided, in divers reſpects. Some in reſpect of their order, or manner of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are termed original, and ſome judicial. Original writs be thoſe, that are ſent out for the ſummoning of the Defendant in a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or Tenent in a real action, or other like purpoſe, before the ſute beginneth, or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the ſute thereby: Thoſe be judicial, that be ſent out by order of the Court, where the cauſe dependeth upon occaſion growing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſute begun, <hi>Old nat. brev. fol.</hi> 51. And Iudicial is thus by one ſign known from the Original, becauſe the <hi>Teſte</hi> beareth the name of the Chief Iuſtice of that Court whence it commeth, where the Original beareth in the <hi>Teſte</hi> the name of the Prince, Then accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of the action, they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, or real: and real be either touching the poſſeſſion, called writs of Entry, or the property, called writs of right. <hi>Fitz. nat. br. ſparſim per totum.</hi> Some writs be at the ſute of a party, ſome of office, <hi>Old nat. br. fol.</hi> 147.
